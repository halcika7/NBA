1,Rick Adelman,"June 16, 1946",,"Saint Pius X in Downey, California",Loyola Marymount University,1989,2014,23,true,,"""[2, 1, 2, 1, 1]""",/coaches/adelmri01c.html,"Richard Leonard Adelman (born June 16, 1946) is an American retired professional basketball player and coach. He coached 23 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He served as head coach of the NBA's Golden State Warriors, Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets and Minnesota Timberwolves.[1] Adelman was born in Lynwood, California, the son of Gladys (née Olsen) and Leonard Joseph ""L. J."" Adelman, who were from North Dakota and worked as teachers and farmers.[2] Adelman began his basketball career as a collegiate star at Loyola University of Los Angeles, now known as Loyola Marymount University.[3] In the 1968 NBA draft, he was selected by the San Diego Rockets (now the Houston Rockets) in the 7th round.[4] He played two seasons in San Diego before being taken by the expansion Trail Blazers in the 1970 expansion draft; he then played three seasons in Portland. He also played for the Chicago Bulls, New Orleans (now Utah) Jazz, and the Kansas City/Omaha (now Sacramento) Kings. He ended his playing career in 1975. From 1977 through to 1983, Adelman coached at Chemeketa Community College in Salem, Oregon. He was then hired by the Portland Trail Blazers (then coached by Jack Ramsay) as an assistant. When Ramsay was fired and replaced with Mike Schuler in 1986, Adelman was retained; when Schuler was in turn fired during the 1988–89 season, Adelman was promoted to interim coach. After leading the team into the playoffs that year (despite a 39–43 record), Adelman was given the coaching position on a full-time basis in the 1989 off-season. The next three years were quite successful for Adelman and the Trail Blazers; the team went to the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992 (losing to the Detroit Pistons and the Chicago Bulls respectively) and went to the Western Conference finals in 1991 (losing to the Los Angeles Lakers). Adelman spent two more years with the team, but was dismissed after the 1993–1994 season. In 1995, Adelman was hired as the head coach of the Golden State Warriors. He was unable to duplicate his success in Portland, and was fired after only two years with the team. After a year's absence from the sidelines, Adelman was hired by the Sacramento Kings in 1998. Under Adelman's guidance, the Kings were one of the most successful teams in the Western Conference, qualifying for the playoffs every year of his Sacramento career. During the Kings' 2000 playoff run, they met Phil Jackson's Los Angeles Lakers. Adelman questioned Jackson's motivational techniques when it was learned that Jackson compared Adelman to Adolf Hitler.[5] In 2002, the Kings made a serious run for the NBA Finals. After clinching the first seed in the competitive Western Conference, the Kings blazed through the opening two rounds but lost to the Lakers in a controversial series with noticeably lopsided officiating in favor of the Lakers.[6] In 2006, Adelman (in the final year of his contract) led the Kings to the playoffs. Despite the team struggling early in the regular season, the Kings rebounded and qualified for the playoffs as the #8 seed. Although competitive, they were defeated 4–2 by the defending champion San Antonio Spurs. Adelman's contract with the Kings expired at the end of the 2005–2006 season. On May 9, it was reported by the Sacramento Bee that his contract would not be renewed. The Kings have yet to reach the playoffs since. The Houston Rockets brought in Rick Adelman as their new head coach, five days after the dismissal of Jeff Van Gundy, on May 18, 2007. Van Gundy had taken the Rockets to three playoff appearances in four years with no series wins. In his first season as head coach, Adelman guided the Rockets to a 22-game winning streak from January through March 2008, the third-longest winning streak in NBA history. In the 2009 season, the Rockets finished 5th in the West with a 53–29 record. They entered the playoffs without their star shooting guard, Tracy McGrady, due to an injury. Despite this loss, the Rockets defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in six games to advance to the Western Conference Semifinals for the first time since 1997. However, they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers, but surprised many people and proved their resilience by taking the series to seven games even though their star center, Yao Ming, had a season-ending injury in Game 3 of that series. Adelman won his 800th career game, 13th among coaches in NBA history, on March 24, 2008 against his old team the Sacramento Kings.[7] On April 18, 2011, Houston Chronicle reported that the Houston Rockets would not give Adelman a new contract, and would part ways after 4 seasons.[8] On September 13, 2011, the Minnesota Timberwolves confirmed the hiring of Rick Adelman as their new coach.[9] On April 6, 2013, Adelman won his 1000th career game with a victory over the Detroit Pistons, becoming just the 8th coach in NBA history ever to do so. Adelman's victory came in front of a home crowd of 15,311, including his wife, Mary Kay, whom he promptly joined after the game to celebrate the occasion. The win came 24 years, 1 month, and 11 days after his first win with the Trail Blazers (February 26, 1989).[10] On April 21, 2014, Adelman announced his retirement from coaching in the NBA. It was also announced that he would stay with the Timberwolves as a consultant.[1] Adelman ranks ninth in terms of games coached and games won. Despite these accomplishments, he went just 79–78 (.503) in playoff games and advanced to the NBA Finals twice, both times with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1990 and 1992 where they lost to the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/1.png

He has served as head coach for three NBA teams, the Detroit Pistons, the Dallas Mavericks, and the Orlando Magic. Adubato replaced Brian Hill halfway through the 1996-97 season and guided the Magic to a 21-12 record and made their fourth consecutive playoff appearance. The Magic then nearly upset Pat Riley's Miami Heat in the playoffs with the help of spectacular play from Penny Hardaway, but ultimately lost the series 3-2. In 1999, Adubato became head coach for the New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association, making his WNBA debut on June 10, 1999 when he guided the Liberty to an 87-60 victory over the defending Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Rockers. With the Liberty posting impressive attendance figures for the third straight season, Madison Square Garden played host to the first-ever WNBA All-Star Game - a sellout (18,649) - on July 14, 1999. Four Liberty players were selected to the Eastern Conference squad: Rebecca Lobo, Teresa Weatherspoon, Kym Hampton, and Vickie Johnson. With Adubato at the helm, the Liberty posted an overall mark of 18-14 and won its first Eastern Conference title. After defeating Charlotte in the first round of the playoffs, the team faced a rematch with the defending WNBA champion Houston Comets. Despite falling short of the title, the series was pushed to a third game when Weatherspoon made the most famous shot in WNBA history -- a half-court, buzzer-beating shot that won Game 2 before a stunned Houston squad and Compaq Center crowd. Under Adubato, the Liberty went to the finals three out of four seasons and won the Eastern Conference regular-season championship three times. Adubato took over as coach of the Washington Mystics, but left the Mystics on June 1, 2007, reportedly upset over his team's 0-4 start to the season, a number of recent transactions, and his contract status. During his NBA coaching career, Adubato replaced Dick Vitale as head coach of the Detroit Pistons after 12 games of the 1979-80 season. He later was head coach of the Dallas Mavericks for 264 games between 1989 and 1992. Adubato currently serves as the radio color analyst for the Orlando Magic. Adubato has also been an assistant NBA coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Dallas Mavericks, Detroit Pistons, New York Knicks, and Orlando Magic and an NBA scout for the Atlanta Hawks.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/2.png
3,Danny Ainge,"March 17, 1959",,"Eugene in North Eugene, Oregon",BYU,1997,2000,4,true,,"""[2]""",/coaches/aingeda01c.html,"Daniel Ray Ainge (born March 17, 1959) is an American basketball executive and former professional basketball and baseball player. Ainge is currently the general manager and President of Basketball Operations for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Ainge was an outstanding high school athlete. At Brigham Young University, he was named national basketball college player of the year and won the John R. Wooden Award for the most outstanding male college basketball player. While in college, Ainge also played parts of three seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB), mostly as a second baseman. He was then drafted into the NBA by the Celtics. Ainge completed 14 seasons, playing for the Celtics, Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings and Phoenix Suns, primarily as a shooting guard. He went on to coach the Suns for three seasons before joining management of the Celtics, with whom Ainge has three NBA Championships to his credit (two as a player, one as President/GM). He is the only person to be named a high school first team All-American in American football, basketball, and baseball. Born in Eugene, Oregon, Ainge starred in high school on his football team and led North Eugene High School to back-to-back state basketball championships in 1976 and 1977, earning all-state honors both years; he was considered one of the top prep football recruits in the state of Oregon. As a junior, he was named to the 1977 Parade magazine High School All-America team. Ainge is the only person to be a high school first team All-American in football, basketball, and baseball.[citation needed] Ainge played basketball at Brigham Young University (BYU). He hit one of the best-known shots in the 1981 NCAA March Madness tournament against Notre Dame when his coast-to-coast drive with seven seconds remaining gave the Cougars a one-point win. Ainge concluded his senior year by winning the Eastman Award, as well as the John R. Wooden Award—given to the best collegiate player in the nation. During his four-year career at BYU, Ainge was an All-American, a two-time First Team Academic All-American, the WAC Player of the Year and a four-time All-WAC selection. He concluded his college career having scored in double figures in 112 consecutive games, an NCAA record at that time. Ainge was selected in baseball's 1977 amateur draft by the Toronto Blue Jays. He made it to the major leagues with the Blue Jays in 1979 while still in college. Mostly a second baseman, he played third base and outfield positions as well, hitting .220 in his baseball career with 2 home runs and 146 hits in 211 games. He is the second-youngest player in Blue Jays history to hit a home run, at 20 years and 77 days, surpassed only by Vladimir Guerrero, Jr. After three years with the Blue Jays, Ainge decided to pursue a career in basketball and was chosen in the 1981 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, who had to buy out Ainge's contract from the Blue Jays after a legal battle. Ainge is among the 13 athletes who have played in both the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball, along with Frank Baumholtz, Gene Conley, Chuck Connors, Dave DeBusschere, Johnny Gee, Dick Groat, Steve Hamilton, Mark Hendrickson, Cotton Nash, Ron Reed, Dick Ricketts, and Howie Schultz.[1] Not everything went well for Ainge in NBA basketball at first. He had a terrible first day of practice, ""shooting 0–2547"", Larry Bird wrote in his autobiography Drive: The Story of My Life. Celtics head coach Bill Fitch gave Ainge a rough time, saying his batting average was better than his shooting percentage on the basketball court. But Ainge became an important piece of the Celtics teams that won the NBA title in 1984 and 1986. Ainge was known as a brash, hard-nosed player who often infuriated opponents. In a 1983 playoff game against Atlanta, he called 7-foot, 1-inch Tree Rollins a sissy, whereupon Rollins elbowed Ainge in the face. Ainge tackled Rollins and the two began wrestling. Tree bit Ainge's middle finger so hard that it required two stitches to keep the tendon together. Ainge was ejected from the contest for starting the fight. The incident prompted the headline ""Tree Bites Man"" on the April 25, 1983, Boston Herald.[2] While playing for the Phoenix Suns, Ainge got into a tussle with Michael Jordan at midcourt; both were given a technical foul. In a 1994 postseason game, Ainge rifled an inbounding pass at the head of Houston Rockets guard Mario Elie, striking him in the face, snapping his neck back.[3][4][5] In 1989, Ainge was traded to the Sacramento Kings, along with Brad Lohaus, for young center Joe Kleine (whom the Celtics saw as a possible successor to the aging Robert Parish) and Ed Pinckney. Ainge and Kleine later became teammates while playing for the Phoenix Suns. In 1990, Ainge was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for Byron Irvin and draft picks. Being a native of Oregon, he was considered a hometown favorite by Blazers fans. He helped the Blazers reach the 1992 NBA Finals, only to succumb to the Chicago Bulls in six games. On June 5, he scored nine points in the extra period to tie an all-time NBA record for most points in an overtime during a finals game. After the 1991–92 season, Ainge became a free agent. He had stated in media interviews that he ideally wanted to stay in Portland and would contact Blazers management before seriously entertaining offers from other teams. On July 1, 1992, however, Ainge signed a contract with the Phoenix Suns on his first day of free agency. The Phoenix Suns were a team looking for a new identity. They inaugurated a new home (America West Arena), hired a new head coach (Paul Westphal), and acquired a new superstar (Charles Barkley). The team also redesigned their logo and uniform when they signed free agent Ainge prior to the 1992–93 season, figuring that his experience would help the team during the playoffs. Ainge responded by scoring 11.8 points per game as the Suns went 62–20 that year and reached the NBA finals, where they lost to Michael Jordan's Bulls in six games. On January 18, 1994, he became the second man ever to hit 900 three-point shots in NBA history (he made 1,002 three-pointers for his career), and he scored 11,964 points for an average of 11.5 points per game, 2,768 rebounds for an average of 2.7, and 4,199 assists, an average of four per game, over 1,042 NBA games. Ainge retired after the 1994–95 season. He was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. He became head coach of the Phoenix Suns in 1996. His resignation from the Suns coaching job in 1999 was a sudden one; he cited a need to spend more time with his family. He was replaced by assistant coach Scott Skiles. Ainge also served as a commentator for the NBA on TNT. In 2003, he was hired as the Executive Director of Basketball Operations for the Celtics. Ainge has often been controversial in his role as a Celtics executive, trading popular players such as three-time All-Star Antoine Walker (earning himself the nickname ""Trader Danny"") and having personality conflicts with then-head coach Jim O'Brien (which eventually led to O'Brien's departure to the Philadelphia 76ers). However, Ainge kept the support of both the Celtics' ownership group and—perhaps most importantly—legendary former head coach Red Auerbach, who was employed by the team as a ""senior assistant"" until his death in October 2006. The 2006–07 Celtics finished with a 24–58 record, second-worst in the team's history. Following the season, Paul Pierce, team captain and face of the franchise, expressed frustration with the team's failures. He requested a trade to a contender if management were unable to acquire veteran talent of Pierce's caliber. Ainge responded with two bold moves that changed the franchise's fortunes almost overnight: the 2007 trades for the Minnesota Timberwolves' Kevin Garnett and the Seattle SuperSonics' Ray Allen immediately returned the Celtics to the ranks of the NBA's elite franchises for the first time since the early 1990s. Together with Pierce, they formed a new ""Big Three"" and led the Celtics to the NBA's best record (66–16) during the 2007–08 season. It was the most dramatic single-season improvement in league history (42 wins more than the previous year), and it earned Ainge the NBA Executive of the Year Award. Boston faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2008 NBA Finals, renewing the long rivalry between the two teams. The Celtics won the series in six games, giving the franchise its 17th NBA championship. Danny Ainge held the trophy for the first time since winning in 1986. In October 2008, after the Celtics' championship season, he was promoted to President of Basketball Operations.[6] On May 3, 2010, Ainge was fined $25K for tossing a towel to distract a Cleveland Cavaliers player shooting a free throw during game 2 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[7] In 2013, Ainge traded Garnett and Pierce, along with Jason Terry and D.J. White, to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for five players plus the Nets' first-round picks in 2014, 2016 and 2018.[8] Boston also received the rights to swap picks with Brooklyn in 2017.[9] It is widely considered one of the most lopsided trades in league history.[10] On August 22, 2017, Ainge made another blockbuster deal, trading All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas, as well as Jae Crowder, Ante Žižić and the rights to the Nets' 2018 first-round draft pick, to the Cleveland Cavaliers for All-Star Kyrie Irving.[11] Eight days later, the deal also included a 2020 second round pick from the Miami Heat as compensation relating to a prior injury to Thomas.[12] In 1996, Danny Ainge made his acting debut in Space Jam, playing himself. While only a brief appearance, Ainge was dubbed ""The Bad Shot Guy"" after catching and shooting the ball at the same time while Charles Barkley roamed the court after having his skills stolen by the Monstars. While a player with the Suns, Ainge opened a national chain of hat stores which he has since sold.[13] He has volunteered his time at a number of charitable organizations and has held a number of jobs since retiring. Ainge and his wife, Michelle, reside in Wellesley, Massachusetts; they have six children (Ashlee, Austin, Tanner, Taylor, Cooper and Crew). Austin Ainge is director of player personnel for the Boston Celtics[14] and like his father, played basketball at BYU. Tanner Ainge is a lawyer and a former political candidate. Ainge's nephew, Erik Ainge, was the starting quarterback on the football team at the University of Tennessee[15] and was selected by the New York Jets in the 5th round of the 2008 NFL Draft. Another nephew, Jake Toolson, currently plays the shooting guard position for BYU. Ainge and his family are active members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in which Ainge served as a bishop. Ainge suffered a mild heart attack in 2009,[16] and another in 2019.[17] He has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder according to a personality test he took when Doc Rivers was coaching the Celtics.[18]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/3.png

Albeck has coached for several teams in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA), including the Denver Rockets, the San Diego Conquistadors, (often subbing for an absent Wilt Chamberlain), the Cleveland Cavaliers, the San Antonio Spurs, the New Jersey Nets, and the Chicago Bulls. Albeck graduated from Chenoa High School in Chenoa, Illinois and received his bachelor's degree at Bradley University in 1955 and his masters at Michigan State University in 1957.[1] He married Phyllis L. Mann in 1952 and they have five children. He began his coaching at Adrian College in Adrian, Michigan.[1] Albeck's next head coaching job was at Northern Michigan University. Albeck was head coach at the University of Denver from 1968 to 1970. He was the head coach of the Denver Rockets during most of the 1970–1971 season. The Rockets had begun the season under head coach Joe Belmont, but Belmont was fired after the team lost 10 of its first 13 games. Albeck replaced Belmont as the Rockets' head coach.[2] The Rockets went 27–44 under Albeck to finish the season with a record of 30 wins and 54 losses. They tied the Texas Chaparrals for fourth place in the Western Division (28 games behind the Indiana Pacers) and on April 1, 1971 lost a one-game playoff to the Chaparrals, 115–109, to determine who would advance into the ABA Western Division semifinals.[3] During the season Denver's average home attendance dropped to 4,139 fans per game from 6,281 the year before.[2] One week after the playoff loss, on April 8, 1971, Albeck was replaced by Alex Hannum as Denver's head coach. Hannum resigned as coach of the San Diego Rockets to become the Rockets' head coach, general manager and president. Albeck then became player personnel director for the Rockets.[4] During the 1972–1973 season Albeck was an assistant coach for the San Diego Conquistadors under head coach K.C. Jones. Albeck also served as director of player personnel for the Conquistadors. During most of the 1973–74 he served under 'Ques' head coach Wilt Chamberlain. Chamberlain missed a few games, during which Albeck filled in as the Conquistadors' head coach, winning all of them.[5] Albeck was an assistant coach for the Kentucky Colonels during the 1974–1975 season in which the team won the 1975 ABA Championship.[6] Albeck returned as an assistant coach with the Colonels during their final season in 1975–1976.[7] He was assistant coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, 1976–1979. Albeck was head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, 1979–1980. He was the San Antonio Spurs' head coach for three seasons, from 1980 to 1983. After the Spurs job, Albeck was the head coach of the New Jersey Nets from 1983 to 1985. Next, Albeck was head coach of the Chicago Bulls, 1985–1986. His exit from Chicago raised eyebrows around the NBA as his replacement, Doug Collins, had been hired by General Manager Jerry Krause just 2 months beforehand as a scout. The hire of Collins was kept a secret from Albeck. From 1986 through 1991 Albeck was head coach for Bradley University, his alma mater. He is a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, as well as a Significant Sig and a member of their Significant Sig Hall of Fame. His all time coaching percentages is .535 for his 7 years as a head coach in the NBA.

He is a graduate of Weequahic High School in Newark, New Jersey and North Carolina A&T State University.[1] He has a bachelor's degree in Physical Education and History along with a master's degree in Curriculum and Instruction.[2] He intended to return to Newark and coach at his local junior high school when he was drafted by the Warriors. He initially declined before accepting and going to training camp.[3] Attles joined the then-Philadelphia Warriors in 1960. On March 2, 1962, he was the team's second-leading scorer with 17 points on the night Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points. There is a probably apocryphal story to the effect that one of the sportswriters covering the game began his filing with the lede ""HERSHEY, Pa. -- Wilt Chamberlain and Al Attles combined for 117 points last night as the Philadelphia Warriors defeated the New York Knicks 169-147.""[4] Attles moved with the team to the Bay Area at the end of the 1962 season, playing until 1971. Attles was known as ""The Destroyer"" due to his defensive specialities along with once punching a player in the jaw.[5] He was a role player on the 1964 Warriors team (with Wilt Chamberlain and Guy Rodgers) that made the NBA Finals and eventually lost the championship series to the Boston Celtics, four games to one. Attles also played on the Warriors' 1967 team that lost to Chamberlain's 68-13 Philadelphia 76ers in an evenly matched, six-game championship series. Attles later became one of the first African-American coaches in the NBA when he was named player-coach of the Warriors midway through the 1969–70 season, succeeding George Lee. Attles guided the Rick Barry-led Warriors to the 1975 NBA championship over the heavily favored Washington Bullets, making him the second African-American coach to win an NBA title (the first was Bill Russell). Attles's team tried to repeat the following season, but they lost to the Phoenix Suns in the Conference Finals in seven games. The team would make the playoffs only once more for the remainder of his tenure as coach. Attles was replaced by Johnny Bach for the last 21 games of the 1979–80 NBA season (a season in which the Warriors finished tied for dead last), though he returned for the next season (Bach would become Attles's permanent successor after 1983). Attles coached the Warriors until 1983, compiling a 557-518 regular season record (588-548 including playoffs) with six playoff appearances in 14 seasons. During the 1983–84 season, Attles worked as the Warriors' general manager. He is the longest-serving coach in Warriors history. In 2014 Attles was the recipient of the John W. Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award—an annual basketball award given by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to an individual who has contributed significantly to the sport of basketball, the award is the highest and the most prestigious honor presented by the Basketball Hall of Fame other than enshrinement. Attles's number 16 is retired by the Warriors and he attends every Warriors home game. He also serves as a team ambassador.[6] On February 7, 2015, Attles's number 22 was retired by North Carolina A&T, the first ever retired by the team.[7] He was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame in 1993. Attles has been on the Warriors' payroll in one capacity or another for 58 years, the longest uninterrupted streak of any person for one team. Attles and his wife Wilhelmina reside in Oakland and have two adult children. On April 6th 2019, Attles was chosen as member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame; Class of 2019.[8]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/7.png
8,Red Auerbach,"September 20, 1917","October 28, 2006","Eastern District in Brooklyn, New York",George Washington,1947,1966,20,true,,"""[1, 2]""",/coaches/auerbre99c.html,"Arnold Jacob ""Red"" Auerbach (September 20, 1917 – October 28, 2006)[1] was an American basketball coach of the Washington Capitols, the Tri-Cities Blackhawks and, most notably, the Boston Celtics. After he retired from coaching, he served as president and front office executive of the Celtics until his death. As a coach, he won 938 games (a record at his retirement)[1] and nine National Basketball Association (NBA) championships in ten seasons (a number surpassed only by Phil Jackson, who won 11 in eighteen seasons). As general manager and team president of the Celtics, he won an additional seven NBA titles, for a grand total of 16 in a span of 29 years,[2] making him one of the most successful team officials in the history of North American professional sports. Auerbach is remembered as a pioneer of modern basketball, redefining basketball as a game dominated by team play and defense and for introducing the fast break as a potent offensive weapon.[2] He groomed many players who went on to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Additionally, Auerbach was vital in breaking down color barriers in the NBA. He made history by drafting the first African-American NBA player, Chuck Cooper in 1950, introduced the first African-American starting five in 1964,[3] and hired the first African-American head coach in North American sports (Bill Russell in 1966).[4] Famous for his polarizing nature, he was well known for smoking a cigar when he thought a victory was assured, a habit that became, for many, ""the ultimate symbol of victory"" during his Boston tenure.[2] In 1967, the NBA Coach of the Year award, which he had won in 1965, was named the ""Red Auerbach Trophy"", and Auerbach was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969.[1] In 1980, he was named the greatest coach in the history of the NBA by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America,[5] and was NBA Executive of the Year in 1980.[1] In addition, Auerbach was voted one of the NBA 10 Greatest Coaches in history, was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, and is honored with a retired number 2 jersey in the TD Garden, the home of the Boston Celtics. Arnold Jacob Auerbach was one of the four children of Marie and Hyman Auerbach. Hyman was a Russian-Jewish immigrant from Minsk, Russia, and Marie Auerbach, née Thompson, was American-born. Auerbach Sr. had left Russia when he was 13,[6] and the couple owned a delicatessen store and later went into the dry-cleaning business. Auerbach spent his whole childhood in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, playing basketball. With his flaming red hair and fiery temper, Auerbach was soon nicknamed ""Red.""[2] Amid the Great Depression, Red played basketball at PS 122 and in the Eastern District High School, where he was named ""Second Team All-Brooklyn"" by the World-Telegram in his senior year. Auerbach received an athletic scholarship to the basketball program of Bill Reinhart at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.[2] Auerbach was a standout basketball player and graduated with a M.A. in 1941.[6] In those years, Auerbach began to understand the importance of the fast break, appreciating how potent three charging attackers against two back-pedalling defenders could be.[2] In 1941, Auerbach began coaching basketball at the St. Albans School and Roosevelt High School in Washington, D.C.[6] Two years later, he joined the US Navy for three years, coaching the Navy basketball team in Norfolk. There, he caught the eye of Washington millionaire Mike Uline, who hired him to coach the Washington Capitols in the newly founded Basketball Association of America (BAA), a predecessor of the NBA.[2] In the 1946–47 BAA season, Auerbach led a fast break-oriented team built around early BAA star Bones McKinney and various ex-Navy players to a 49–11 win–loss record, including a standard-setting 17-game winning streak that stood as the single-season league record until 1969. In the playoffs, however, they were defeated by the Chicago Stags in six games.[6][7] The next year the Capitols went 28–20[6] but were eliminated from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker.[2] In the 1948–49 BAA season, the Caps won their first 15 games and finished the season at 38–22.[6] The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the Minneapolis Lakers, who were led by Hall-of-Fame center George Mikan. In the next season, the BAA and the rival league National Basketball League merged to become the NBA, and Auerbach felt he had to rebuild his squad. However, owner Uline declined his proposals, and Auerbach resigned.[2] After leaving the Capitols, Auerbach became assistant coach of the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team.[8] It was assumed that Auerbach would take over for head coach Gerry Gerard, who was battling cancer. During his tenure at Duke, Auerbach regularly worked with future All-American Dick Groat. Auerbach later wrote that he ""felt pretty bad waiting for [Gerard] to die"" and that it was ""no way to get a job"".[9] Auerbach left Duke after a few months when Ben Kerner, owner of the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, gave him the green light to rebuild the team from scratch. Auerbach traded more than two dozen players in just six weeks, and the revamped Blackhawks improved, but ended the 1949–50 NBA season with a losing record of 28–29. When Kerner traded Auerbach's favorite player John Mahnken, an angry Auerbach resigned again.[2] Prior to the 1950–51 NBA season, Walter Brown, owner of the Boston Celtics, was desperate to turn around his struggling and financially strapped franchise, which was reeling from a 22–46 record.[6] Brown, in characteristic candor, said to a gathering of local Boston sportswriters, ""Boys, I don't know anything about basketball. Who would you recommend I hire as coach?"" The group vociferously answered that he get the recently available Auerbach, and Brown complied. In the 1950 NBA draft, Auerbach made some notable moves. First, he famously snubbed Hall-of-Fame New England point guard Bob Cousy in the 1950 NBA draft, infuriating the Boston crowd. He argued that the flashy Cousy lacked the poise necessary to make his team, taunting him as a ""local yokel"".[2] Second, he drafted African-American Chuck Cooper, the first black player to be drafted by an NBA club.[10] With that, Auerbach effectively broke down the color barrier in professional basketball.[3] In that year, the core of the Celtics consisted of Hall-of-Fame center Ed Macauley, Auerbach's old favorite McKinney, and an unlikely addition, Cousy. Cousy had refused to report to the club that had drafted him (which happened to be the Blackhawks, Auerbach's old club), and because his next team (the Chicago Stags) folded, he ended up with the Celtics. With Auerbach's fast-break tactics, the Celtics achieved a 39–30 record but lost in the 1951 NBA Playoffs to the New York Knicks. However, the relationship between Auerbach and Cousy improved when the coach saw that the ""Houdini of the Hardwood""—as the spectacular dribbler and flashy passer Cousy was lovingly called—became the first great playmaker of the fledgling NBA.[2] In the following 1951–52 NBA season, Auerbach made a remarkable draft pick of future Hall-of-Fame guard Bill Sharman. With the high-scoring Macauley, elite passer Cousy, and new prodigy Sharman, Auerbach had a core that provided high-octane fast-break basketball. Other notable players who joined the Celtics were forwards Frank Ramsey and Jim Loscutoff. In the next years until 1956, the Celtics would make the playoffs every year, but never won the title. In fact, the Celtics often choked in the playoffs, going a mere 10–17 in the postseason from 1951 through 1956.[6] As Cousy put it: ""We would get tired in the end and could not get the ball.""[11] As a result, Auerbach sought a defensive big man who could both get easy rebounds, initiate fast breaks, and close out games.[2] Before the 1956 NBA draft, Auerbach had already set his sights on defensive rebounding center Bill Russell. Via a draft-day trade that sent Macauley and rookie Cliff Hagan to the rival St. Louis Hawks (Kerner had moved the Blackhawks to St. Louis), he acquired a center in Russell, who would go on to become one of the greatest basketball players of all time. In the same draft, Auerbach picked up forward Tom Heinsohn and guard K.C. Jones, also two future Hall-of-Famers. Emphasizing team play rather than individual performances, and stressing that defense was more important than offense, Auerbach drilled his players to play tough defense and force opposing turnovers for easy fast-break points. Forward Tom Sanders recalled that the teams were also regularly among the best-conditioned and toughest squads.[11] Anchored by defensive stalwart Russell, the tough Celtics forced their opponents to take low-percentage shots from farther distances (there was no three-point arc at the time); misses were then often grabbed by perennial rebounding champion Russell, who then either passed it on to elite fast-break distributor Cousy or made the outlet pass himself, providing their sprinting colleagues opportunities for an easy slam dunk or layup.[2] Auerbach also emphasized the need for role players like Frank Ramsey and John Havlicek, who became two of the first legitimate sixth men in NBA history,[11] a role later played by Don Nelson. Auerbach's recipe proved devastating to the opposition. From 1957 to 1966, the Celtics won nine of ten NBA championships. This included eight consecutive championships—which is the longest championship streak in North American sports—and six victories over the Los Angeles Lakers of Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West in the NBA Finals. The streak also denied perennial scoring and rebounding champion Wilt Chamberlain a title during Auerbach's coaching reign.[12] Flowing from Auerbach's emphasis on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams was that they never seemed to have a dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list.[11] In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would go a step further in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area.[11] Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.[11] All in all, Auerbach directly coached nine NBA championship teams and mentored four players—Russell, Sharman, Heinsohn, and K.C. Jones—who would go on to win an additional seven NBA championships as coaches (two each for Russell, Heinsohn and Jones, all with the Celtics, and one for Sharman with the Lakers). Ten players who played for Auerbach have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame—Macauley, Ramsey, Cousy, Sharman, Heinsohn, Russell, K. C. Jones, Havlicek, Sam Jones and Bailey Howell. Although Don Nelson played for Auerbach only during his last year as coach, his influence was profound: Nelson would later join Auerbach as one of the 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history.[2] Sharman and Heinsohn would become two of only four people to be inducted into the Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. Few if any coaches can match Auerbach's record of wins and successful mentorship of his players. Prior to the 1965–66 NBA season, Auerbach announced the coming year would be his last as coach, stating to the rest of the league, ""This is your chance to take your last shot at me."" After losing game 1 of the 1966 finals to the Lakers, he publicly named his successor, center Bill Russell. The Celtics won the series in seven games, sending Auerbach out on top. Russell then took over as a player-coach, and so became the first African-American head coach ever in the four major North American professional team sports.[2] While his pupil led the Celtics to two further titles in 1968 and 1969, Auerbach rebuilt the aging Celtics with shrewd draft picks, among them future Hall-of-Famers Dave Cowens and Jo Jo White, as well as Paul Westphal and Don Chaney. With his ex-player Tom Heinsohn coaching the Celtics and led by former sixth man John Havlicek, Auerbach's new recruits won the Atlantic Division every year from 1972 to 1976, winning the NBA title in 1974 and 1976. Auerbach also signed veteran forward/center Paul Silas and ex-ABA star Charles Scott.[6] However, Auerbach could not prevent the Celtics from going into a slump at the end of the 1970s. He traded away both Silas and Westphal because they wanted salary increases that would have made them higher earners than the best player on the Celtics (Cowens), which was not acceptable to Auerbach. While the Westphal trade to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Charlie Scott was considered a success due to the Celtics' 13th title in 1976, Auerbach later admitted he erred in letting Silas go, even after Cowens personally begged him to give Silas a new deal. When Havlicek retired in 1978, the Celtics went 61–103 in two seasons.[6] In the summer of 1978, after the worst in a string of contentious clashes with several different owners after Walter Brown's passing in 1964, Auerbach hopped into a taxi to take him to Logan Airport, where he was to board a flight to New York to consider a lucrative contract offer from Knicks owner Sonny Werblin. However, the cab driver pleaded with him to stay, emphasizing how much Bostonians loved him and considered him family.[13] Soon after, heading a team press conference, and with his typical bravado, Auerbach puffed on his trademark cigar and stated simply, ""I'm not going anywhere. We're going to sign Larry Bird, and we're going to be on top again."" Despite knowing that Bird, a talented young player from unheralded Indiana State, had a year of college eligibility remaining, he had drafted Bird as a junior eligible in the 1978 NBA draft and waited for a year until the future Hall-of-Fame forward Bird arrived, finally setting aside his team salary rules when it became clear that his choices were paying Bird a record-setting rookie salary or watch him simply re-enter the 1979 draft. Bird then became the highest-paid Celtic as a rookie, with a $650,000-per year deal. Auerbach knew that the brilliant, hardworking Bird would be the cornerstone of a new Celtics generation.[2] In 1980, Auerbach achieved another great coup, which was dubbed ""The Steal of The Century"".[14] He convinced the Golden State Warriors to trade him a #3 overall pick and future Hall-of-Fame center Robert Parish in exchange for two picks in the 1980 NBA draft: #1 overall Joe Barry Carroll and the #13 pick Rickey Brown. With the #3 pick, Auerbach selected the player he most wanted in the draft, Kevin McHale, who would also be inducted into the Hall of Fame. The frontcourt of Parish-McHale-Bird became one of the greatest front lines in NBA history. Auerbach hired head coach Bill Fitch who led the revamped Celtics to the 1981 title. In 1983, Auerbach named former Celtics player K.C. Jones coach of the Celtics. Starting in 1984, Jones coached the Celtics to four straight appearances in the NBA Finals, winning championships in 1984 and 1986. Auerbach as a part-time side gig was the color analyst on NBA and college basketball games for TBS sports from 1982-87.[15][16] In 1984, Auerbach relinquished his general managing duties and became president and later vice-chairman of the Boston Celtics.[6] In a surprising move after winning their 15th title, he traded popular guard Gerald Henderson, the game 2 hero in the finals against the Lakers, for Seattle's first round draft pick in 1986. Two years later, after the Celtics defeated Houston in the finals for their 16th championship, he used the second overall pick in the 1986 draft, the pick acquired from Seattle, to take college prodigy Len Bias from Maryland, arguably the most brilliant coup in Auerbach's stellar career. With the team's star players still in their prime, the defending champions appeared set to compete at the top for years. However, tragedy struck just two days later, when Bias died of a cocaine overdose. Several years later, Celtics star player Reggie Lewis died suddenly in 1993, and without any league compensation for either loss, the team fell into decline, not seeing another Finals in Auerbach's lifetime.[6] In an interview, Auerbach confessed that he lost interest in big-time managing in the early 1990s, preferring to stay in the background and concentrating on his pastimes, racquetball and his beloved cigar-smoking. He would, however, stay on with the Celtics as president until 1997, as vice chairman until 2001, and then became president again, a position he held until his death,[11] although in his final years, he was weakened by heart problems and often used a wheelchair.[17] Auerbach was one of four children of American-born Marie Auerbach and Russian Jewish immigrant Hyman Auerbach in Brooklyn. His brother Zang Auerbach, four years his junior, was a respected cartoonist and portraitist at the Washington Star.[12] He married Dorothy Lewis in the spring of 1941. The couple had two daughters, Nancy and Randy.[11] Auerbach was known for his love for cigar smoking. Because Auerbach made his victory cigars a cult in the 1960s, Boston restaurants would often say ""no cigar or pipe smoking, except for Red Auerbach"".[11] In addition, Auerbach was well known for his love of Chinese food. In an interview shortly before his death, he explained that since the 1950s, Chinese takeout was the most convenient nutrition: back then, NBA teams travelled on regular flights and had a tight time schedule, so filling up the stomach with heavier non-Chinese food meant wasting time and risking travel-sickness. Over the years, Auerbach became so fond of this food that he even became a part-owner of a Chinese restaurant in Boston.[12] Despite a heart operation, he remained active in his 80s, playing racquetball and making frequent public appearances. Despite his fierce nature, Auerbach was popular among his players. He recalled that on his 75th birthday party, 45 of his former players showed up;[11] and when he turned 80, his perennial 1960s victim Wilt Chamberlain showed up, a gesture which Auerbach dearly appreciated.[12] In an interview with ESPN, Auerbach stated that his all-star fantasy team would consist of Bill Russell—who in the former's opinion was the ultimate player to start a franchise with—as well as Bob Pettit, Elgin Baylor, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West, with John Havlicek as the sixth man. Regarding greatest basketballers of all time, Auerbach's candidates were Russell, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan.""[11] Auerbach died of a heart attack on October 28, 2006 at the age of 89.[18] NBA commissioner David Stern said, ""the void caused by his death will never be filled"" and players Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, John Havlicek and Larry Bird, as well as contemporaries like Jerry West, Pat Riley, and Wayne Embry universally hailed Auerbach as one of the greatest personalities in NBA history.[17] Bird stated ""Red shared our passion for the game, our commitment to excellence, and our desire to do whatever it takes to win."" Auerbach was survived by his two daughters, Nancy and Randy. Auerbach was interred in Falls Church, Virginia at King David Memorial Gardens within National Memorial Park on October 31, 2006. Attendees included basketball dignitaries Bill Russell, Kevin McHale, Danny Ainge, and David Stern. During the 2006–07 NBA season, NBA TV and NBA.com aired reruns of Auerbach's four-minute instructional videos known as ""Red on Roundball"" previously aired during NBA on CBS halftime shows in the 1970s and 1980s, and as a testament to his importance in the Boston sports world, the Boston Red Sox honored Auerbach at their April 20, 2007 game against the New York Yankees by wearing green uniforms and by hanging replicated Celtics championship banners on the ""Green Monster"" at Fenway Park. Boston won 7–6. Prior to Boston's season opener against the Wizards, his signature was officially placed on the parquet floor near center court, thereby naming the court as ""Red Auerbach Parquet Floor."" The ceremony was attended by his daughter Randy and some of the Celtics legends. The signature replaced the Red Auerbach memorial logo used during the 2007 season. Auerbach was the author of seven books. His first, Basketball for the Player, the Fan and Coach, has been translated into seven languages and is the best-selling basketball book in print.[2] His second book, co-authored with Paul Sann, was Winning the Hard Way. He also wrote a pair of books with Joe Fitzgerald: Red Auerbach: An Autobiography and Red Auerbach On and Off the Court. In October 1991 M.B.A.: Management by Auerbach was co-authored with Ken Dooley. In 1994, Seeing Red was written with Dan Shaughnessy. In October 2004, his last book, Let Me Tell You a Story, was co-authored with sports journalist John Feinstein. Among Auerbach's accomplishments during his 20-year professional coaching career were eleven Eastern Division titles (including nine in a row from 1957–65), 11 appearances in the finals (including ten in a row from 1957–66), and nine NBA championships. With a total of 16 NBA championship rings in a span of 29 years (1957–86) as the Celtics coach, general manager, and team president, Auerbach is the most successful team official in NBA history.[2] He is credited with creating several generations of championship Boston Celtics teams, including the first Celtics dynasty with Bill Russell, which won an NBA record eight titles in a row (1959–66). As Celtics general manager, he created championship-winning teams around Hall-of-Famers Dave Cowens in the 1970s and Larry Bird in the 1980s.[2] In addition to coaching, Auerbach was a highly effective mentor; several players coached by Auerbach would become successful coaches themselves. Bill Russell won two titles as Auerbach's successor, Tom Heinsohn won a pair of championships as a Celtics coach in the 1970s, K.C. Jones led the Celtics to two further titles in the 1980s, and Bill Sharman coached the Los Angeles Lakers to their first title in 1972. In addition, prototypical sixth man Don Nelson had a highly successful coaching career and joined his mentor Auerbach as one of 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history. Throughout his coaching tenure in Boston, Auerbach served several other roles including, but not limited to, general manager, head of scouting, personnel director and travel agent.[19] In the early offseasons, he would take the Celtics on barnstorming tours around New England, promoting the still fledgling NBA. At the end of every season, regardless of their on-court success, he would approach owner Brown and ask, ""Walter, are our last paychecks going to clear?"" to which Brown would always positively respond, and they would. Despite Brown's own close association with the NHL's Boston Bruins, whose owners also possessed the Boston Garden, the Celtics were fleeced on concessions and profits as tenants. During this era, when most team owners not only thought of, but also treated their players as cattle and/or slaves, athletes from all the four major professional sports leagues were fighting for their rights and economic fairness. As Auerbach represented management of the Celtics, team members frustrated with their salaries had only him to complain to, or about, in their role in the formation of the players' union. These interpersonal dynamics are construed as follows by journalist David Halberstam:[20] Pertaining to the above, Walter Brown was not rich; also that as Auerbach was as tough at the negotiating table as he was on the practice court and in the locker room, it was always for the purpose of getting the most out of his players. In the summer of 1984, with much trepidation, Auerbach reluctantly signed former finals MVP Cedric Maxwell to a lucrative guaranteed contract to stay with the Celtics. Then, Auerbach's worst fears came true when Maxwell arrived that fall out of shape, and, suffering from various injuries, provided little contribution as the team lost a playoff for the first time ever to the Lakers in the 1985 Finals. Two subsequent facts are perhaps most relevant in evaluating Auerbach's legacy: First, he was able to trade Maxwell to San Diego in exchange for former MVP Bill Walton, who was a major contributor to the team winning its 16th title in 1986, the last of Auerbach's career. Second, Maxwell continues to be embraced as a beloved member of the Celtics family, including having his number retired alongside the team's legendary greats. In Auerbach's honor, the Celtics have retired a number-2 jersey with the name ""AUERBACH"", memorializing his role as the second most important Celtic ever, behind founder Walter Brown, in whose honor the number-1 ""BROWN"" jersey is retired. His story is documented in The First Basket, the first and most comprehensive documentary on the history of Jews and Basketball. He is also featured as an interviews subject for the film. From his early days, Auerbach was convinced that the fast break, where a team used a quick outlet pass to fast guards who run downcourt and score before the opponent had re-established position, was a potent tactical weapon. This new strategy proved lethal for the opposition.[2] Further, Auerbach moved emphasis away from individual accolades and instilled the teamwork element into his players.[6] He also invented the concept of the role player and of the sixth man,[2][21] stating: ""Individual honors are nice, but no Celtic has ever gone out of his way to achieve them. We have never had the league's top scorer. In fact, we won seven league championships without placing even one among the league's top 10 scorers. Our pride was never rooted in statistics.""[6] While Auerbach was not known for his tactical bandwidth, famously restricting his teams to just seven plays,[6] he was well known for his psychological warfare, often provoking opposing players and officials with unabashed trash talk. For his fiery temper, he was ejected more often and received more fines than any other coach in NBA history.[11] Age did nothing to diminish his fire; in 1983, after star Larry Bird was ejected from a preseason game against Philadelphia at the Garden along with the Sixers' role player Marc Iavaroni, Auerbach stormed onto the court and after taking the officials to task, screamed nose-to-nose with the 6'10"" 260-pound Moses Malone. Concerning his own team, Auerbach was softer. Earl Lloyd, the first black player to play in the NBA, said: ""Red Auerbach convinced his players that he loved them [...] so all they wanted to do was please him.""[11] Auerbach was known for choosing players for talent and motivation, with disregard for skin color or ethnicity. In 1950, he made NBA history by drafting the league's first African-American player, Chuck Cooper. He constantly added new black players to his squad, including Bill Russell, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, K.C. Jones, and Willie Naulls. In 1964, these five players became the first African-American starting five in the NBA. When Auerbach gave up coaching to become the Celtics general manager in 1966, he appointed Bill Russell as his successor. Russell became the first black NBA coach, and was the first black coach of a professional sports organization since Fritz Pollard in 1925.[3] Similarly, in the 1980s, as the Celtics GM, Auerbach fielded an earnest, hardworking team that was derided as being ""too white.""[22] While the 1980s Celts were, in actuality, neither predominantly white nor black, the NBA at the time was predominately black. White players like Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Danny Ainge, and Bill Walton played alongside Tiny Archibald, Dennis Johnson, Robert Parish, and Cedric Maxwell to bring three more championships in the '80s under coaches Bill Fitch (white) and K.C. Jones (black). To honor Auerbach, the Celtics created the Arnold ""Red"" Auerbach award in 2006. It is an award given annually to the current Celtic player or coach who ""best exemplifies the spirit and meaning of a true Celtic."" The NBA gives out an annual coach of the year award to honor the league's best coach as voted by a panel of sportswriters. The trophy is named the 'Red Auerbach trophy'[23] and has a figure of Auerbach sitting on a bench.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/8.png
9,Randy Ayers,"April 16, 1956",,"North in Springfield, Ohio",Miami University,2004,2004,1,true,,"""[2]""",/coaches/ayersra99c.html,"Randall Duane Ayers (born April 16, 1956) is an American basketball coach. He is currently an assistant for the Phoenix Suns. His son Ryan is an assistant coach for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish Men's Basketball team.[1] Ayers was born in Springfield, Ohio, the fourth of eight children of Frank Ayers and Betty Basey. He played basketball at North High School in Springfield, where he was named Ohio high school Class AAA (big-school) player of the year in 1974.[2] Ayers attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he played basketball. Ayers made his mark more as a defender, rebounder and playmaker than as a scorer, as Miami teammates Archie Aldridge as well as Chuck Goodyear provided much of the offense. As a freshman in 1974–75, Ayers saw significant playing time, averaged 8.5 points per game (ppg) with a .560 field goal percentage as the Redskins, coached by Darrell Hedric, posted a 19-7 record.[3] He was named honorable mention All-Mid-American Conference (MAC) As a sophomore in 1975–76, Ayers became a starter and averaged 10.9 ppg as the team finished 18-8 and second in the MAC. He was again named honorable mention All-MAC.[3] As a junior in 1976–77, Ayers increased his scoring average to 12.8 ppg and 8.1 rebounds per game (rpg) as, for the third season, he was named honorable mention All-MAC. The Redskins posted an overall record of 20-6 and were MAC co-champions.[3] In his senior year of 1977–78, Ayers increased his scoring average for the third straight year with 13.4 ppg and had 7.0 rpg. He was named second-team All-MAC as his teammate, Archie Aldridge, earned MAC Player of the Year. Ayers was also named Miami's Defensive Player of the Year.[3] Miami's record was 19-9 but they earned an outright MAC championship and earned a berth in the NCAA tournament.[3] Miami opened the tournament with a thrilling 84-81 overtime win over defending national champion Marquette, a game in which Ayers had a double-double with 20 points and 10 rebounds plus three assists.[4] In the next round they were defeated by eventual national champion Kentucky, 91-69, although Ayers had another big game with 18 points, eight rebounds and three assists.[5] Ayers earned a bachelor's degree in Education from Miami in 1978, and in 1981 he earned a master's in Education.[6] He was drafted in the third round of the 1978 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls, but was cut from the team and then played professionally in Reno, Nevada for the Reno Bighorns in the fledgling Western Basketball Association.[7][8] Ayers earned second-team all-league honors, but the WBA folded after one season.

He coached college basketball at Texas Tech for a season-and-a-half from 1969 to 1971.[3][4] He coached The Floridians of the ABA for two years before the team folded at the end of the 1972 season. The next season, he coached the Memphis Tams; and, at the beginning of the 1974/75 season, Bass was hired by the ABA's San Antonio Spurs, which he coached for nearly two seasons, until the franchise moved into the NBA in 1976 as part of the ABA–NBA merger. At that point, Bass moved into the Spurs' front office, assuming the role of general manager. He would, over the years with the team, assume coaching duties on an interim basis as needed—in 1980, 1984, and 1992. He finished his coaching career with a 311-300 record.

He played 14 seasons as a small forward in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers, appearing in eight NBA Finals. Baylor was a gifted shooter, strong rebounder, and an accomplished passer. Renowned for his acrobatic maneuvers on the court, Baylor regularly dazzled Lakers fans with his trademark hanging jump shots. The No. 1 draft pick in 1958, NBA Rookie of the Year in 1959, 11-time NBA All-Star, and a 10-time member of the All-NBA first team, he is regarded as one of the game's all-time greatest players.[1] In 1977, Baylor was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[2] Baylor spent 22 years as general manager of the Los Angeles Clippers. He won the NBA Executive of the Year Award in 2006 before being relieved of his duties shortly before the 2008–09 season began.[3] His popularity led to appearances on the television series Rowan and Martin's Laugh In in 1968, the Jackson Five's first TV special in 1971 and a Buck Rogers in the 25th Century episode, ""Olympiad"". Elgin ""Rabbit"" Baylor had two basketball-playing brothers, Sal and Kermit. After stints at Southwest Boys Club and Brown Jr. High, Baylor was a three-time All-City player in High School. Elgin played his first two years at Phelps Vocational High School in the 1951 and 1952 seasons where he set his first area scoring record of 44 points vs. Cardozo. During his two All-City years at Phelps, he averaged 18.5 and 27.6 points per season. He did not perform well academically and dropped out of school (1952–53) to work in a furniture store and play basketball in the local recreational leagues. Baylor reappeared for the 1954 season playing for the newly-opened Spingarn High School, and the 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m), 190 lb (86 kg) senior was named first-team All-Met and won the SSA's Livingstone Trophy as the area's best basketball player for 1954. He finished with a 36.1 average for his eight Interhigh Division II league games. On February 3, 1954, in a game against his old Phelps team, he scored 31 in the first half. Playing with four fouls the entire second half, Baylor scored 32 more points to establish a new DC-area record with 63 points. This broke the point record of 52 that Western's Jim Wexler had set the year before when he broke Rabbit's record of 44. An inadequate scholastic record kept him out of college until a friend arranged a scholarship at the College of Idaho, where he was expected to play basketball and football. After one season, the school dismissed the head basketball coach and restricted the scholarships. A Seattle car dealer interested Baylor in Seattle University, and Baylor sat out a year to play for Westside Ford, an AAU team in Seattle, while establishing eligibility at Seattle.[4] The Minneapolis Lakers drafted him in the 14th round of the 1956 NBA Draft, but Baylor opted to stay in school instead. Baylor led the Seattle University Chieftains (now known as the Redhawks) to the NCAA championship game in 1958, Seattle's only trip to the Final Four, falling to the Kentucky Wildcats. Following his junior season, Baylor was drafted again by the Minneapolis Lakers with the No. 1 pick in the 1958 NBA Draft, and this time he opted to leave school to join them for the 1958–59 NBA season. In his three collegiate seasons, one at College of Idaho and two at Seattle, Baylor averaged 31.3 points per game. He led the NCAA in rebounds during the 1956–57 season.[5] Fifty-one years after Baylor left Seattle University, they named its basketball court in honor of him on November 19, 2009. The Redhawks now play on the Elgin Baylor Court in Seattle's KeyArena. The Redhawks also host the annual Elgin Baylor Classic. The College of Idaho has announced that Baylor will be one of the inaugural inductees into the school's Hall of Fame in June 2017.[6] The Minneapolis Lakers used the No. 1 overall pick in the 1958 NBA draft to select Baylor, then convinced him to skip his senior year at SU and instead join the pro ranks. The team, several years removed from its glory days of George Mikan, was in trouble on the court and at the gate. The year prior to Baylor's arrival, the Lakers finished 19–53 with a squad that was slow, bulky and aging. Baylor, whom the Lakers signed to play for $20,000 per year (equivalent to $180,000 in 2019), was the franchise's last shot at survival. With his superb athletic talents and all-round game, Baylor was seen as the kind of player who could save a franchise, and he did. According to Minneapolis Lakers owner Bob Short in a 1971 interview with the Los Angeles Times: ""If he had turned me down then, I would have been out of business. The club would have gone bankrupt.""[citation needed] As a rookie in 1958–59, Baylor finished second in the league in scoring (24.9 points per game), third in rebounding (15.0 rebounds per game), and eighth in assists (4.1 assists per game).[7] He registered 55 points in a single game, then the third-highest mark in league history behind Joe Fulks' 63 and Mikan's 61. Baylor won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and led the Lakers from last place the previous year to the NBA finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics in the first four-game sweep in finals history. Thus began the greatest rivalry in the history of the NBA.[8] During his career, Baylor helped lead the Lakers to the NBA Finals seven more times. From the 1960–61 to the 1962–63 seasons, Baylor averaged 34.8, 38.3 and 34.0 points per game, respectively. On November 15 of the 1960–61 season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks, while also grabbing 25 rebounds.[9] In doing so, Baylor had broken his own NBA record of 64 points that he had set in the previous season. Baylor, a United States Army Reservist, was called to active duty during the 1961–62 season, and being stationed in Washington, he could play for the Lakers only when on a weekend pass. Despite playing only 48 games during the 1961–62 season, he still managed to score over 1,800 points. Later that season, in a Game Five NBA Finals victory against the Boston Celtics, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in an NBA Finals game with 61. Baylor began to be hampered by knee problems during the 1963–64 season. The problems culminated in a severe knee injury suffered during the 1965 Western Division playoffs. Baylor, while still a very powerful force, was never quite the same, never again averaging above 30 points per game. Baylor finally retired nine games into the 1971–72 season because of his nagging knee problems. The timing of his retirement caused him to miss two great achievements—the Lakers' next game after his retirement was the first of an NBA-record 33 consecutive wins,[10] and then the Lakers went on to win the NBA championship that season. The Lakers awarded Baylor a 1972 Championship Ring even though he had retired earlier.[11] Baylor was the last of the great undersized forwards in a league where many guards are now his size or bigger.[12] He finished his playing days with 23,149 points, 3,650 assists and 11,463 rebounds over 846 games. His signature running bank shot, which he was able to release quickly and effectively over taller players, led him to numerous NBA scoring records, several of which still stand. The 71 points Baylor scored on November 15, 1960, was a record at the time. The 61 points he scored in Game 5 of the NBA Finals in 1962 is still an NBA Finals record. An underrated rebounder, Baylor averaged 13.5 rebounds per game during his career, including a remarkable 19.8 rebounds per game during the 1960–61 season—a season average exceeded by only five other players in NBA history, all of whom were 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) or taller. A 10-time All-NBA First Team selection and 11-time NBA All-Star, Baylor was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1977. He was named to the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1980 and the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996. in 2009, SLAM Magazine ranked him number 11 among its Top 50 NBA players of all time. He is often listed as the greatest NBA player never to win a championship.[13][14][15] The first biography of Elgin Baylor was written by SLAM Online contributor Bijan C. Bayne, and published by Rowman and Littlefield. On April 6, 2018, Baylor appeared at Staples Center as a VIP guest during the Lakers vs. Timberwolves game. A statue was unveiled in his honor prior to the event. In 1974, Baylor was hired to be an assistant coach and later the head coach for the New Orleans Jazz, but had a lackluster 86–135 record and retired following the 1978–79 season. In 1986, Baylor was hired by the Los Angeles Clippers as the team's vice president of basketball operations. He stayed in that capacity for 22 years before reportedly[16] resigning in October 2008 at the age of 74. During his tenure, the Clippers managed only two winning seasons and amassed a win-loss record of 607 and 1153. They also won only one playoff series during this time. Baylor was selected as the NBA Executive of the Year in 2006. That year the Clippers won their first playoff series since 1976, when the franchise was located in Buffalo, New York, and named the Buffalo Braves. In February 2009, Baylor filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the Clippers, team owner Donald Sterling, team president Andy Roeser, and the NBA. He alleged that he was underpaid during his tenure with the team and then fired because of his age and race.[17] Baylor later dropped the racial discrimination claims in the suit.[18] Baylor's remaining claims were rejected by a Los Angeles state court jury on March 30, 2011, by a unanimous 12–0 vote.[19]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/15.png

Beilein was raised in Burt, New York.[14] He is the eighth of nine children of a millworker and an apple farmer.[14] His mother's cousins were the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan, and two of his uncles (Tom and Joe Niland) were lifelong basketball coaches in the Western New York area.[14] Beilein attended DeSales High School in Lockport, New York.[2] He went on to attend Wheeling College (now Wheeling Jesuit University) where he competed on the school's basketball team from 1971 to 1975 and served as team captain during the 1974–75 season. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1975.[2] After graduating, Beilein returned to Western New York where he began his coaching career at Newfane High School in 1975. He remained there for three years.[2] Beilein went on to earn a Master of Science degree in education from Niagara University in 1981.[2] Beilein has never served as an assistant coach; he has held head-coaching positions throughout his career. He served as the coach of Erie Community College from 1978 to 1982, Western New York's Division III Nazareth College in Rochester, New York for the 1982–1983 school year,[15] and Le Moyne College from 1983 to 1992. Le Moyne was a Division II contestant in the Mideast Collegiate Conference (MCC).[16] Beilein first applied to coach Division I basketball at Canisius in 1987, but he was not hired.[17] During his time at Le Moyne, he held annual coaching clinics that welcomed coaches and athletes.[18] Beilein was named the 1988 MCC Coach of the Year, when his team finished as co-conference champions with a 21–5 regular season record and number 14 national ranking.[19] The team tied with Gannon University with an 8–2 conference record.[20] Although it was Beilein's third 20-win team at Le Moyne, they had never gone to the NCAA tournament before.[21] The team captured the conference post-season tournament after receiving a first round bye.[22] As the number three seed, they faced the number one seeded California University of Pennsylvania in the NCAA Division II Eastern Regionals.[23] They lost their first-round game to fall to a 23–6 record,[24] but won the consolation game against Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. The MCC disbanded following the 1990–1991 season.[25] In Beilein's final season at Le Moyne, the team was an independent team unaffiliated with a conference. The team was scheduled to join the New England Collegiate Conference for the 1992–1993 season.[26] After his first application for the job at Canisius, Beilein had tried to land other Division I jobs at schools such as Colgate University, where he had been a finalist in 1989. In 1992, he was finally hired to a Division I post at Canisius.[15] During the 1991–92 season, Canisius compiled an 8–22 record prior to Beilein's arrival.[27] In 1992, he arrived at Canisius College as head coach for the 1992–93 season, and was able for the first time to hire assistant coaches.[28] A Western New York native, he had grown up a Canisius basketball fan because his uncle, Joe Niland, had been a former player and coach there.[15] At Canisius—his first Division I coaching position—Beilein reached the NCAA Tournament once and the NIT twice in his five seasons. In his first two seasons at Canisius, Beilein turned a last place 1991–92 squad into a 1993–94 team that recorded the first undefeated home schedule (15–0) in the school's modern era.[29] The team entered the 1994 MAAC Tournament on a 15-game winning streak,[30] and Beilein earned Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Coach of the Year.[31] Beilein's number one seeded Canisius team lost in the second round semi-final contest against Loyola University and thus failed to make the 1994 NCAA Tournament.[32] Although Canisius failed to be invited to participate in the NCAA tournament, Canisius was invited, along with two other schools from the MAAC, to the NIT tournament,[33] and it was matched up against a taller, more experienced Villanova team.[34] The eventual 1994 NIT champion Villanova prevailed in a 103–79 victory over Canisius in the first round.[35][36][37] During the 1994–95 season, the Golden Griffins were led by the team's first MAAC Player of the Year, senior Craig Wise. In the first round of the MAAC tournament, a pair of future Michigan Wolverine coaches opposed each other when Canisius met Loyola, coached by Brian Ellerbe.[38] Canisius won and reached the MAAC semi-final for the fifth time in six years.[39] The team lost in the semis for the third straight season,[40] and it continued its record of never having won the conference tournament.[39] Canisius earned the team's first post-season victory in 32 years, in the 1995 NIT, against Seton Hall.[41] A pair of subsequent wins enabled Canisius to earn a trip to the semifinals of the 1995 NIT at Madison Square Garden.[42][43] Canisius lost in the semifinals against Virginia Tech by a 71–59 despite a school postseason record 32 points from Wise.[44] Canisius lost the consolation game against Penn State.[45] The three wins and two losses enabled Beilein to even up his NIT career record at 3–3. In 1995–96, the team also was led by a MAAC Player of the Year, Darrell Barley.[46] Beilein coached the 16–10 (7–7 MAAC) team to the conference tournament championship to earn a birth in the 1996 NCAA Tournament despite the absence of the injured Barley for the tournament.[47] Canisius earned a thirteen seed and matchup against the fourth-seeded Utah Utes in the team's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1957.[48] Utah defeated Canisius in the game, 72–43.[49][50] In Beilein's final season coaching Canisius, the Golden Griffins were the top defensive team in the MAAC.[51] The team's season ended in the conference tournament finals.[52] After the 1996–97 season, he interviewed with the University of Richmond.[53] Beilein was inducted into the Canisius Sports Hall of Fame on September 24, 2019, for his tenure and success with the program.[54][55] In 1997, Beilein moved to become the coach of the Richmond Spiders. There, he compiled a 100–53 record in five seasons, recording a winning record each season, and again reached the NCAA tournament once, where his 14th-seeded team upset third-seeded and nationally ranked South Carolina. His teams also reached the NIT twice. During the 1997–98 season, A third Beilein player was named conference player of the year in six seasons when Jarod Stevenson was named Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) Player of the Year. The 1997–98 Spiders posted its first winning season since 1993.[56] The Spiders entered the 1998 CAA tournament as the third seed in the nine-team conference.[57] The team won the tournament, earning the school a 1998 NCAA Tournament selection, its first NCAA tournament berth since 1991.[58] He won his fourth Coach of the Year award that season. This one was for the Richmond Times-Dispatch Virginia Coach of the Year. Beilein was selected for the award over Charlie Woollum of William and Mary who beat Beilein for the CAA coach of the year award.[5] During the NCAA Tournament, Richmond, which was seeded 14th upset the South Carolina team in the first round of the tournament.[59][60] The Spiders lost their second game in the tournament to the Washington Huskies team.[61] Beilein's career NCAA tournament record was 1–2. Beilein relied on a nucleus that included two freshmen and two sophomores after two returning starters were removed from the team for disciplinary reason during the 1998–99 season. The team finished third in the CAA with a 15–11 (10–6 CAA) record.[62] However, they were upset in the 1999 CAA conference tournament by sixth-seeded cross-town rival Virginia Commonwealth.[63] Richmond again earned the third seed in the conference tournament over the course of the 1999–2000 season. In the 2000 CAA Conference tournament they ousted number-six Old Dominion and number-two James Madison.[64][65] Then with the CAA conference's automatic bid to the 2000 NCAA Tournament at stake, Richmond lost to fourth seeded UNC Wilmington in the championship game.[66] During the 2000–01 season, Richmond finished the regular season with a 21–6 record, finishing first in the CAA with a 12–4 record. The Spiders won ten of their final eleven games.[67] However, since Richmond was going to change its athletic affiliation from the CAA to the Atlantic 10 the following season, it was ineligible for the 2001 CAA conference tournament.[68] Only one team from the CAA had ever earned an at large bid to the NCAA tournament.[69] The Spiders wound up playing in the 2001 NIT, where they defeated West Virginia before losing to Dayton.[70][71] With one win and one loss Beilein stayed at .500 in the NIT, at 4–4. At the end of the season, Beilein declined an offer to coach at Rutgers.[72] The victory over West Virginia is credited with being a large part of why Beilein was eventually hired at West Virginia.[73] The following year during the 2001–02 season, Richmond finished in second place of the West Division of the 12-team Atlantic 10 Conference to earn a first-round bye in the 2002 Atlantic 10 Tournament.[74] In the tournament Richmond won its first two games to advance to the finals where it lost to Xavier.[75] During the 2002 NIT, Richmond defeated Wagner,[76][77] Montana State,[78] and Minnesota before losing to Syracuse in the quarterfinals.[79][80] This improved Beilein's record to 7–5 in the NIT. Dan Dakich was hired at West Virginia (WVU) of the Big East Conference and then quit 8 days later.[73][81] In April 2002, Beilein accepted the head coaching position at WVU.[72] At WVU he posted a 104–60 record over five seasons. In the 2004–05 season, WVU went 24–11 and reached the ""Elite Eight"" (fourth round) of the NCAA tournament. The following year, WVU went 22–11 and reached the ""Sweet Sixteen"" (third round). In 2006–07, Beilein's Mountaineers, despite losing about 80% of their scoring from the previous season, went 27–9 and won the NIT championship. Prior to 2009, the Big East Tournament only included the top 12 teams. During the 2002–03 season, West Virginia qualified for the tournament in their final conference game of the season by beating Virginia Tech to secure 6th place in the western division.[82] The team had improved from 8–20 to finish the regular season at 14–14 (5–11 Big East) under Beilein.[83] The team lost in the first round of the 2003 Big East Tournament to Providence by a 73–50 margin to end their season.[84] Following the 2003–04 regular season, West Virginia qualified for the 2004 Big East Tournament as the number 10 seed.[85] The team lost its first round match against Notre Dame team by a 65–64 margin on a three-point shot with 15 seconds remaining.[86][87] The team's 15–13 record earned it an invitation to the 2004 NIT. In the first round of the tournament, the team traveled to play a 22–8 Kent State.[88] Despite early foul trouble the team won 65–54 to advance to the second round.[89][90] West Virginia defeated Rhode Island in the second game of the tournament by a 79–72 margin.[91] The season ended with a 74–53 loss to Rutgers in the following game.[92] Beilein's career record in the NIT tournament was 9–6 after this tournament. In 2004–05, Beilein's team entered the 2005 Big East Tournament with an 18–9 record as the eighth seed and as a team on the bubble for the 2005 NCAA Tournament.[93][94] The team won its opening-round game against number nine seed Providence 82–59,[95][96] its second-round game against number one seed Boston College 78–72,[97][98] and its third-round game against number four Villanova 78–72.[99][100] West Virginia lost the conference tournament finals to Syracuse 68–59,[101] but it earned a seven seed in the NCAA tournament against number ten seed Creighton of the Missouri Valley Conference.[102][103][104] The loss gave Beilein his fifth loss in as many games against his mentor Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, who had helped him acquire each of his first three Division I coaching positions.[105] In the NCAA tournament, West Virginia beat Creighton 63–61 with a defensive stop and fast break dunk in the final five seconds.[106][107] West Virginia then defeated the number two seed Wake Forest team led by Chris Paul in double overtime 111–105.[108][109][110] In the Sweet Sixteen round, West Virginia defeated Bobby Knight's number six seeded Texas Tech 65–60.[111][112] In the elite eight round, they lost 93–85 in overtime to Rick Pitino's number four seeded Louisville, who were led by Taquan Dean and Larry O'Bannon.[113][114] With the three wins in 2005, Beilein raised his career NCAA Tournament record to 4–3. During the 2005–06 season, West Virginia won its first eight Big East conference games and entered the top ten in the 2005–06 national rankings in February.[115][116] It was the first time West Virginia had ranked in the top ten in the Coaches' Poll, which had been created in 1993.[116] They were the final unbeaten team in conference play.[116] After the strong start, the team lost four of its next five games to fall to 9–4 in conference play.[117][118] They won their next two games to clinch a first-round bye in the 2006 Big East Tournament.[119][120] With seemingly little to play for,[121] they lost their regular season finale to finish with a 20–9 (11–5 Big East) regular season record.[122] West Virginia lost its quarterfinal round game in the conference tournament to Pitt,[123][124] and earned a number six seed in the 2006 NCAA Tournament.[125][126] West Virginia won its opening weekend games against number eleven seed Southern Illinois and the number fourteen seed Northwestern State Demons by 64–46 and 67–54 margins, respectively.[127][128][129] West Virginia then lost in the Sweet Sixteen round to the number two seed Texas Longhorns in a wild finish that saw West Virginia erase a five-point deficit in the final fourteen seconds only to lose the game on a buzzer-beater.[130][131][132] The two wins helped Beilein raise his NCAA tournament record to 6–4. During the 2006–07 season, WVU finished the regular season with a 21–8 (9–7 Big East) record to earn the number seven seed in the 2007 Big East Tournament. In the first round of the tournament, they defeated the number ten seed Providence 92–79 making a Big East Tournament record 17 three-point shots.[133][134] They lost to the second-seeded Louisville Cardinals, 82–71, in double overtime.[135][136] Their 22–9 record earned them a top seed in the 32-team 2007 NIT.[137][138] As the number one seed, West Virginia was able to play its first three games at home where it defeated the Delaware State Hornets 74–50,[139][140] UMass team 90–77,[141] and NC State 71–60.[142][143] Before West Virginia started play in the semifinals in New York, rumors started that Beilein would take the Michigan job after the season ended.[144] In the semifinal contest against Mississippi State, they won 63–62 on a last-minute shot by Darris Nichols after recovering from a 14-point second-half deficit.[145][146] The day before the championship game, Beilein was announced as one of three finalists (along with Kevin Stallings and Chris Lowery) for the Michigan Wolverines' head coaching job.[147] In the championship game, WVU defeated Clemson 78–73.[148][149] The five wins raised Beilein's NIT career record to 14–6. On April 3, 2007, the University of Michigan announced that it had hired Beilein to fill its coaching vacancy. He replaced Tommy Amaker, who was fired after failing to reach the NCAA Tournament in his six seasons. Beilein inherited a Big Ten Conference team that was in the final year of a scholarship reduction due to the involvement of former players in the Ed Martin scandal, in which NCAA rules had been violated.[150] The team struggled to a 10–22 (5–13) record during the 2007–08 season. Beilein's second Michigan team, the 2008–09 Wolverines took a significant step forward. On November 20, the unranked Wolverines upset #4-ranked UCLA, recording their first win over a top-five team in eleven years.[151][152] On December 6, Michigan posted its second win of the season over a top-five opponent in a rematch against #4 ranked Duke.[153][154] The Wolverines reached the top 25 in the national rankings on December 22, its first appearance since the February 6, 2006.[155] On February 26, Michigan defeated the #16-ranked Purdue team 87–78, raising its record to 3–4 against ranked opponents on the season.[156] At the conclusion of the 2008–09 Big Ten season, Michigan was given a seven seed in the 2009 Big Ten Tournament. A win over Iowa in the Big Ten Tournament on March 12 was the Wolverines' twentieth of the season. With that win, Beilein had achieved a 20-win season at seven different schools, including four at the Division I level (Canisius, Richmond, West Virginia, Michigan).[2] Three days later, Beilein's Wolverines earned a bid to the 2009 NCAA Tournament, the school's first appearance in 11 years. There, tenth-seeded Michigan defeated the seventh-seeded Clemson Tigers 62–59[157] before losing in the second round to Oklahoma 73–63.[158] The 2010–11 team was not expected to be very successful, projected by the Detroit News to finish 10th in the 11-team conference.[159] After starting the conference schedule with a 1–6 record the team won eight of its last 11 games, including two games against Michigan State (its first season sweep against them in 14 years), to finish tied for fourth in the conference with a 9–9 record.[160] The victory at Michigan State was Michigan's first since 1997.[161] In the Big Ten Tournament, Michigan's win over Illinois gave Beilein his second 20-win season at Michigan, in his 1,000th game as a head coach.[162] As a #8 seed in the 2011 NCAA Tournament,[163] Michigan defeated Tennessee 75–45, establishing two NCAA Tournament records: the largest victory margin by an eight seed, and becoming the first team to ever win a tournament game without making a free throw.[164] Michigan won by its third-largest margin in its NCAA tournament history (second-most if vacated games are excluded), and the game marked the ninth straight time that John Beilein led a team victory in its first game of a postseason tournament (5 NCAA and 4 NIT).[165] In the next round the Wolverines lost to #1-seeded Duke, 73–71, missing a potential game-tying shot in the final seconds.[166] The 2011–12 Wolverines began the season ranked in the top 25, and remained there all season. The team recorded a win over 9th-ranked Michigan State on January 17, 60–59.[167] It was Beilein's third consecutive win over the Spartans and came nine days after Beilein recorded his first victory over Wisconsin, 59–41.[168] On February 18, the Wolverines defeated another top-10 opponent, edging 6th-ranked Ohio State, 56–51.[169] The win clinched Beilein's first winning record in Big Ten play. On March 1, Michigan won at Illinois for the first time since 1995, ending a 13-game losing streak in Champaign.[170] The Wolverines finished 24–10 overall and 13–5 in Big Ten play, winning a share of the regular-season Big Ten championship for the first time since the 1985–86 team.[171] By helming the 2012–13 Wolverines, Beilein reached his sixth season with the same team for the first time.[172] Beilein achieved several milestones with the 2012–13 Wolverines: 650th win as a college basketball head coach (December 4 vs. Western Michigan),[173] 100th win as head coach at Michigan (December 8 vs. Arkansas),[174] 400th Division I win as a head coach (January 9 vs. Nebraska)[175] and his best career start (December 15 vs. West Virginia).[176] The 400th win came on a night when Michigan achieved its 16th straight victory which tied the school record for best start.[175][177] Michigan went on to record its first 19–1 start to a season in school history.[178] On January 28, Michigan was ranked number one in the AP Poll with 51 of the 65 first place votes.[179] It marked the first time Michigan ranked atop the AP Poll since the 1992–93 team did so on December 5, 1992.[178] John Beilein was selected as an assistant coach for the 2013 World University Games.[180][181] In the 2013 NCAA Tournament, fourth-seeded Michigan defeated South Dakota State, 71–56.[182] in its South Regional opening game, and in so doing the team matched Beilein's career high with 27 wins.[183] Michigan then surpassed this record, and continued to advance, by defeating fifth-seeded Virginia Commonwealth, 78–53[184] and top-seeded Kansas,[185][186] 87–85 before beating third-seeded Florida 79–59 to send Michigan to the Final Four for the first time since 1993.[187][188] In the 2013 Final Four, the Wolverines defeated East region champion Syracuse, 61–56, to advance to the national championship game against Louisville, which they lost, 82–76. During the following offseason, Bleacher Report named Beilein the most creative coach in college basketball.[189] During the offseason, Beilein signed a second contract extension through the 2018–19 season, raising his annual salary to $2,450,000.[190] The 2013–14 team was ranked in the top 10 to start the season,[191][192] but lost four non-conference games to fall out of the polls for the first time in over two seasons.[193][194] Then, the team won three in a row against top-10 ranked conference opponents including a road victory over 3rd-ranked Wisconsin [195] en route to a 10-game winning streak. Beilein led Michigan to a 15-3 conference record and won Michigan's first outright regular season Big Ten championship since 1986. The Wolverines earned a #2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they lost in the Elite Eight to eventual runner-up Kentucky.[196] Beilein was one of ten finalists for the USBWA's Henry Iba Award for Coach of the Year.[197] He clinched his fourth career conference championship and second at Michigan on March 1 against Minnesota, and won the title outright three days later at Illinois.[198][199] Following the regular season, Beilein was named Big Ten Coach of the Year by the media.[6][200] On March 11 Beilein was named District V (OH, IN, IL, MI, MN, WI) Coach of the Year by the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA).[201][202] Beilein was named one of five finalists for the Naismith College Coach of the Year and one of fifteen finalists for the Jim Phelan Award.[203][204] On March 22 in Michigan's second game of the 2014 NCAA Tournament, against Texas, Beilein earned his 700th career win to advance to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament for the second consecutive season.[4][205][206] Beilein led Michigan on to beat the #11 seed University of Tennessee before falling to #8 seed Kentucky 75-72 in the Elite Eight.[207] The 2014–15 team entered the season ranked number 23 in the Coaches' Poll and number 24 in the AP Poll.[208][209] The team struggled in the preconference schedule, losing four games in a row in December.[210] In January, the team lost Caris LeVert and Derrick Walton to injuries in January and after a 6–3 conference start[211] finished 8–10 in conference and 16–16 overall (going 5–9 in games without LeVert and Walton).[212] Prior to the 2015–16 season, Michigan extended Beilein's contract through the 2020–21 season.[213] During the Wolverines' 2016–17 season Beilein achieved several milestones: 750th career win as a head coach (December 22 vs. Furman),[214] his 200th career win as head coach at Michigan (January 4 vs. Penn State), and his 500th career Division I win as a head coach (February 22 vs. Rutgers).[215] Beilein became the second coach in program history to reach 200 wins with the Wolverines, joining Johnny Orr, who was the all-time leader with 209 until Beilein surpassed him with a win over Illinois on March 9, 2017 at the 2017 Big Ten Tournament.[216][217] Michigan went on to win its next three games to achieve its first Big Ten Tournament title since its 1998 title that has been vacated.[218] With wins over 10th-seeded Oklahoma State and 2nd-seeded Louisville, the Wolverines advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. In June 2017, Beilein's title was renamed as the David and Meredith Kaplan Men's Basketball Head Coach at Michigan. UM alums David Kaplan and his wife, Meredith Kaplan, gave a $7.5 million gift to the University of Michigan Athletic Department for funding for the head basketball position and other items.[219] The 2017–18 Wolverines won the 2018 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament to claim their second consecutive Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament championship. They became the first team to win consecutive tournament championships since Ohio State in 2010 and 2011.[220][221][222] On March 24, Michigan defeated Florida State 58–54 in the West regional finals of the 2018 NCAA Tournament. With the win, Michigan advanced to the Final Four for the eighth time in program history and set a single-season program record with its 32nd victory of the season, surpassing the previous record of 31 wins set by the 1992–93 and 2012–13 teams.[223][224] After outlasting Loyola Chicago in the Final Four game, they fell to Villanova in the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game.[225][226] Accolades came Beilein's way. Prior to the commencement of the Final Four, Beilein was named the CBSSports.com's Coach of the Year.[227] Then during the offseason, Beilein was inducted into the Basketball Coaches Association of Michigan Hall of Fame.[228][229] Following their late season burst and strong tournament play, the 2018–19 Wolverines were ranked number 18 in the Coaches' Poll and number 19 in the AP Poll to start the season.[230] With a victory over Norfolk State on November 6, 2018, Beilein earned his 800th career win as a head coach.[231] In the third game of the season, Michigan defeated Villanova 73-46 in a rematch of the 2018 national championship game. Michigan went on to win its first 17 games of the season, which included wins over ranked North Carolina,[232] Purdue,[233] and Indiana teams.[234] In doing so, the 2018–19 team set the school record for most wins to start a season (surpassing the 2012–13 and 1985–86 teams by a game) and tied the 1984–85 team for most consecutive wins altogether. Michigan finally lost on January 19 to Wisconsin but shared the distinction of being the last undefeated team in the country with Virginia.[235] After finishing the regular season 28-6, the Wolverines defeated Montana and Florida in the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament to clinch their second straight 30-win season (a first in school history) and third consecutive Sweet 16 appearance. Beilein finished his career at Michigan with a 278–150 record in 12 seasons as head coach, including two trips to the national title game, two Big Ten titles and two Big Ten Tournament titles. On May 13, 2019, Beilein was named head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), signing a five-year contract.[236][237] Beilein is known for his offensive system, which emphasizes constant motion, passing, disciplined teamwork, and precision shooting. The offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc, and one player at the top of the key (though at times a post player may operate closer to the basket). From this formation, Beilein's teams not only try to open up space for players to cut to the basket, but also are known for their high number of three-point attempts.[238] On defense, Beilein's West Virginia teams were known for regularly employing the 1–3–1 halfcourt zone defense,[239] which is considered to be an unconventional zone defense[240][241] – though his Michigan teams have more frequently employed man-to-man and 2-3 zone defenses. Beilein is married to Kathleen Beilein (née Griffin) since 1978.[242] The Beileins have three sons (Patrick, who played for his father at WVU and was the head basketball coach at Niagara University; Mark, a former football player at Richmond and WVU grad who currently works for Alro Steel;[243][244] and Andrew, a Michigan grad who currently works for the Business Roundtable in Washington, D.C.[245]) and a daughter (Seana Hendricks). Patrick, who was the 2002 Virginia Independent Schools Division I Player of the Year, had intended to play at Richmond with his father, and instead went to West Virginia when his father moved there.[246][247] Patrick was a 2008–2009 season graduate assistant coach at University of Michigan.[248][249] He has since held posts as assistant coach at Dartmouth, Director of Men's Basketball Operations at Bradley University, and head coach of West Virginia Wesleyan College before his current role at Le Moyne.[250] When Patrick was a highly recruited high school basketball player, John was restricted by NCAA rules from some normal behaviors regarding his son, such as giving his son's teammates a ride home from practice, talking with his son at a basketball camp or discussing his son's abilities with news media, because the interactions of college coaches with recruits are restricted.[251] The relevant NCAA rules for recruiting (Bylaw article 13) are quite extensive.[252] Beilein had to follow recruiting rules when visiting his son at a basketball camp.[251] According to rule 13.12.1.3 coaches wishing to attend a camp as observers must comply with appropriate recruiting contact and evaluation periods.[252] According to 13.02.3, a contact includes any face-to-face encounter between a prospective student-athlete . . . and an institutional staff member or athletics representative during which any dialogue occurs in excess of an exchange of a greeting.[252] In short, talking to coaches not employed by a camp is not allowed during the camp, which left Beilein unable to offer his son milk money.[251]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/18.png

Berry was born in Winnemucca, Nevada[1] and graduated from Humboldt County High School in 1960. He then attended Michigan State University. From 1961 to 1964, Berry played on the Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team under coach Forddy Anderson.[2][3] At Michigan State, Berry was the top team rebounder for the 1962–63 season with 184 total rebounds and 9.2 per game.[4] Berry earned his bachelor's degree in 1965 and master's degree in 1969 from Michigan State, both in physical education.[3] Berry began his coaching career in 1966 as head varsity basketball coach at Highlands High School of North Highlands, California and stayed as coach until 1969.[2][3] After completing his master's degree at Michigan State, Berry became head coach at Cosumnes River Junior College from 1970 to 1972. Then, Berry became an assistant coach at the NCAA Division I level with California until 1977. Berry then returned to his alma mater Michigan State to be an assistant coach under Jud Heathcote and was part of the coaching staff of the 1979 NCAA championship team that featured Magic Johnson.[3] From 1979 to 1989, Berry was the head men's basketball coach at San Jose State. For the San Jose State Spartans, Berry had a 142–144 record, then the Spartans' second-highest win total under one coach.[3] Under Berry, San Jose State had a 17–12 record in the 1979–80 season, won the 1980 PCAA tournament, and made the 1980 NCAA tournament.[5] In a 21-9 season in 1980–81, San Jose State qualified for the 1981 National Invitation Tournament.[6] San Jose State also had three straight seasons over .500 from 1984 to 1987.[7] However, the 1988–89 Spartans finished 5-23.[8] In January 1989, when the team was 5-11, 10 of the 14 players on the Spartans men's basketball team accused Berry of ""mental cruelty"" and refused to play or practice under Berry as coach. However, the players declined to provide specific examples.[9] Berry then organized a new team of walk-on athletes, including star football player Johnny Johnson.[10] San Jose State dismissed Berry after the season on March 24, 1989.[11] After San Jose State, Berry entered the NBA as a scout and assistant coach for the Sacramento Kings in 1989. He transferred to the Houston Rockets as a scout in 1991 and then assistant coach in February 1992 under Rudy Tomjanovich. Berry was an assistant coach to the Rockets 1994 and 1995 championship teams. From 1999 to 2003, Berry was an assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls[3] Berry was an assistant under Tim Floyd until Floyd resigned on Christmas Eve (December 24) of 2001, when the Bulls named Berry as interim head coach.[12] Berry coached two games, both losses, and Bill Cartwright became permanent head coach effective December 28.[13] On September 7, 2006, the Washington Wizards announced that Bill Berry would join the team as an assistant coach to head coach Eddie Jordan.[14] Bill Berry has been married to Clarice ""Reese"" Berry since 1963 and had two children.[2][15] The Berry family lived in Morgan Hill, California during Bill Berry's tenure at San Jose State.[16] Their son Ricky Berry (1964–1989) played college basketball at San Jose State under Bill Berry and in the NBA for the Sacramento Kings before committing suicide in 1989.[2]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/20.png
21,Bill Bertka,"August 8, 1927",,,Kent State University,1994,1999,2,true,,"""[1]""",/coaches/bertkbi99c.html,"Bill Bertka (born August 8, 1927) is a current basketball consultant/special assistant and a former National Basketball Association (NBA) assistant coach, scout and executive with the Los Angeles Lakers and New Orleans Jazz. A pioneering proponent of film study, advance scouting, player development and basketball analytics, Bertka has spent more than 50 years in the NBA and has been a part of 10 NBA championships with the Lakers, including seven as an assistant coach. Bertka was born in Akron, Ohio, in August 1927 and later credited the local Akron YMCA as the place where he developed a passion for the game of basketball. He played at nearby Buchtel High and won a city championship in 1945.[1] He went into the U.S. Army out of high school, serving in communications rebuilding efforts for two years in Salzburg, Austria, following the conclusion of World War II. Using the GI Bill to fund his education upon his return from Europe, Bertka attended Kent State University and played for the Division I basketball team from 1949-51.[2] After graduating, Bertka began a coaching journey that brought him to the West Coast. He coached at the high school level for three years before spending nine years at two different colleges. It was at that time, during a two-year span beginning in 1952, that Bertka played professionally for the Santa Maria Golden Dukes of the National Industrial Basketball League, a precursor to the NBA.[2] In 1954, he took over in his first collegiate head coaching role at Hancock College (Santa Maria, CA), where he would later lead the Bulldogs to a 41-game winning streak and the state community college championship in 1957.[1] Bertka also coached his alma mater of Kent State from 1957-61, where, at the age of 30, he was one of the youngest college head coaches in America.[2] He left coaching in 1961 to take a job as the director of community recreation for the city of Santa Barbara, where he served for a decade. It was during this time that he and his wife, Solveig, began an endeavor called ""Bertka's Views"" that became one of the most successful college scouting services in the country.[2] Operating from 1961-1995, many of the nation’s premier college basketball programs utilized Bertka’s Views as their sole scouting service, which also served as a key starting point for a number of scouts and coaches that would eventually make it to the NBA. Additionally during this time, Bertka hosted Sports With Bertka, his own radio show in Santa Barbara that won three Golden Mike Awards in the 1970’s. Bertka began his NBA career in 1968 when the Los Angeles Lakers followed the recommendation of former West Virginia great Rod Hundley and hired him to scout college players for the NBA Draft,[3] making him the first full-time scout in league history.[4] When Head Coach Bill Sharman took over the team in 1971-72, Bertka began working with players in an assistant coaching role while also adding advance scouting duties. In what was revolutionary at the time, he would compile film on upcoming opponents in order to prepare the team. That group would later go on a 33-game winning streak – still a professional sports record – en route to an NBA title, giving Bertka his first ring. In 1974, Bertka left the Lakers to become the first general manager of the New Orleans Jazz (now the Utah Jazz) and also had an initial ownership stake in the franchise through his company, Invest West Sports. He would later serve as a Jazz assistant coach under Elgin Baylor beginning in the 1977-78 season. In 1981, Pat Riley became head coach of the Lakers and brought Bertka back as his first assistant. Together, the duo constructed what came to be known as the Lakers “Showtime” era, guiding the team to seven NBA Finals appearances in nine seasons and winning four NBA titles (1982, 1985, 1987, 1988). During this time, Bertka and Riley created their own measure of player performance – the plus-minus system – in what became one of the league’s earliest preludes to modern basketball analytics. Bertka remained as an assistant coach with the Lakers for two decades, later winning back-to-back championships under Head Coach Phil Jackson in 2000 and 2001, his final season on the Lakers bench. Bertka then transitioned to a primary role as Director of Scouting, a position in which he served through the 2011-12 season, winning three more league titles. He continues to advise the Lakers as a basketball consultant. Bertka has twice served as interim coach of the Lakers. His first stint, in relief of Randy Pfund toward the end of the 1993-94 season, lasted two games. The Lakers went 1-1, winning at Dallas, 112-109, and losing at Houston, 113-107. He also replaced Del Harris in the 1998-99 season, defeating the Clippers by a score of 115-100.[3] At 71 years of age, the interim stint made Bertka the oldest person to ever coach an NBA game.[5] Throughout his career, Bertka has coached some of the best players in the game’s history – including Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Earvin “Magic” Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant, among others. Overall, he has 10 NBA Championship rings, including seven as an assistant coach with the Lakers and three in other roles with the team. Bertka is a member of several halls of fame, including the Santa Barbara Sports Hall of Fame (1989), the Summit County (OH) Sports Hall of Fame (1989), the Kent State University Sports Hall of Fame (2004) and the Santa Barbara Basketball Court of Champions (2014). In July 2019, he received the prestigious Tex Winter Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Basketball Coaches Association, an honor recognizing Bertka’s extraordinary contributions to the sport throughout his career by building a body of work that has had a positive and powerful impact on the NBA coaching profession.[4] Bertka and wife Solveig were married in 1956 and have two daughters - Britt, who is married to veteran NBA assistant coach Jim Eyen, and Kris, married to Yankees scout Bill Pintard – and they live on a 50-acre avocado farm in Santa Barbara.[5]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/21.png

He has also been an assistant for the Portland Trail Blazers,[3] Chicago Bulls,[4] Los Angeles Lakers, and Cavaliers. He has served in numerous other NBA front office positions, and has been a consultant for the Harlem Globetrotters. Bickerstaff was born in Benham, Kentucky, where his father and grandfather worked in the coal mines. He often had to endure open racism. He attended East Benham High School, where he was the starting point guard of the basketball team. After graduating in 1961, Bickerstaff moved to Cleveland where he had relatives, with the idea of joining the Army, but he instead accepted a basketball scholarship to play for Rio Grande College. The racial tension he experienced during his time playing there made him leave school early and head back to Cleveland to work in a steel mill. However, the difficult working conditions prompted him to accept a second opportunity to play college basketball at the University of San Diego from 1964 to 1966. As a senior, he was named team captain and MVP, when the Toreros finished 17-11 and went on to play at the Small College Regional Playoffs. He is a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. After finishing his college eligibility, Bickerstaff was hired by his coach Phil Woolpert to serve as an assistant for the 1968–69 season. After three seasons at 25 years old, he was named the head coach of the University of San Diego after Woolpert's abrupt resignation, keeping this position for the next four years. In 1972–1973 his team finished 19–9 and his four-year overall record was 54–49. In 1973, Bickerstaff was hired as an assistant for the Washington Bullets by then coach K. C.

Bickerstaff was twice named IBL Coach of the Year.[5] In 2003, Bickerstaff was hired by Ed Tapscott to become the expansion Charlotte Bobcats' first head coach and general manager. Bickerstaff was hired by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2012–13 as an assistant coach to Mike Brown.[6] On November 9, 2012, Bickerstaff was named interim head coach of the Lakers after Brown was fired.[7] Three days later, the Lakers signed former Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni as their official head coach, although D'Antoni's on-court debut was delayed as he recovered from knee-replacement surgery. Bickerstaff continued to coach the Lakers in D'Antoni's absence,[8] ending his stint with a 4–1 record, the highest winning percentage in Lakers' history, albeit in only five games.

Nicknamed ""The Hick from French Lick"", Bird is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Drafted into the NBA by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft, Bird started at small forward and power forward for the Celtics for 13 seasons. Bird was a 12-time NBA All-Star and received the NBA Most Valuable Player Award three consecutive times (1984–1986). He played his entire professional career for Boston, winning three NBA championships and two NBA Finals MVP awards. Bird was also a member of the gold-medal-winning 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team known as ""The Dream Team"". He was voted to the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996, was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame again in 2010 as a member of ""The Dream Team"". After retiring as a player, Bird served as head coach of the Indiana Pacers from 1997 to 2000. He was named NBA Coach of the Year for the 1997-1998 season and later led the Pacers to a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals. In 2003, Bird was named President of Basketball Operations for the Pacers, holding the position until retiring in 2012.[1] He was named NBA Executive of the Year for the 2012 season. Bird returned to the Pacers as President of Basketball Operations in 2013[2] and remained in that role until 2017. As of 2020,[update] Bird is the only person in NBA history to be named Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, NBA Finals MVP, All-Star MVP, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year.[3] Bird was born in West Baden Springs, Indiana, to Georgia (née Kerns) and Claude Joseph ""Joe"" Bird, a veteran of the Korean War.[4] He was raised in nearby French Lick, where his mother worked two jobs to support Larry and his five siblings.[5] Bird has said that being poor as a child still motivates him ""to this day"".[6] Georgia and Joe divorced when Larry was in high school, and Joe committed suicide about a year later.[7] Larry used basketball as an escape from his family troubles, starring for Springs Valley High School and averaging 31 points, 21 rebounds, and 4 assists as a senior on his way to becoming the school's all-time scoring leader.[4][8] Bird received a scholarship to play college basketball for the Indiana University Hoosiers in 1974.[9] After less than a month on campus he dropped out of school, finding the adjustment between his small hometown and the large student population of Bloomington to be overwhelming.[4] He returned to French Lick, enrolling at Northwood Institute (now Northwood University) in nearby West Baden, and working municipal jobs for a year before enrolling at Indiana State University in Terre Haute in 1975.[10][11][12] He had a successful three-year career with the Sycamores, helping them reach the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history with a 33-0 record where they played the 1979 championship game against Michigan State.[13][14] Indiana State lost the game 75–64, with Bird scoring 19 points but making only 7 of 21 shots.[4] The game achieved the highest ever television rating for a college basketball game, in large part because of the matchup between Bird and Spartans' point guard Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson,[5] a rivalry that lasted throughout their professional careers. Despite failing to win the championship, Bird earned numerous year-end awards and honors for his outstanding play, including the Naismith College Player of the Year Award.[14] For his college career, he averaged 30.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game,[15] leading the Sycamores to an 81–13 record during his tenure.[14] Bird also appeared in one game for the baseball team, going 1-for-2 with 2 RBI.[16] He graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education.[17] Bird was selected by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft.[15] He did not sign with the Celtics immediately; instead, he played out his final season at Indiana State and led the Sycamores to the NCAA title game. Red Auerbach publicly stated that he would not pay Bird more than any Celtic on the current roster, but Bird's agent bluntly told Red that Bird would reject any sub-market offers and simply enter the 1979 NBA Draft instead, where Boston's rights would expire the second the draft began and Bird would have been the likely top pick. After protracted negotiations, Bird inked a five-year, $3.25 million contract with the team, making him the highest paid rookie in league history at the time.[8][18] Shortly afterwards, NBA draft eligibility rules were changed to prevent teams from drafting players before they were ready to sign, a rule known as the Bird Collegiate Rule.[18] In his rookie season (1979–1980), Bird immediately transformed the Celtics into a title contender. The team improved its win total by 32 games from the year before he was drafted and finished first in the Eastern Conference.[19][20] In his career debut, Bird recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists in a 114-106 win over the Houston Rockets.[21] On November 14, 1979, Bird recorded his first career triple-double having recorded 23 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists in a 115–111 win over the Detroit Pistons.[22] On November 23, Bird recorded his first 30-point scoring game after he scored 30 points to go along with 11 rebounds and 3 assists in a 118-103 win over the Indiana Pacers.[23] With averages of 21.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 1.7 steals per game for the season, he was selected to the All-Star Team and named Rookie of the Year.[15] In the Conference Finals, Boston was eliminated by the Philadelphia 76ers.[20] Before the 1980–81 season, the Celtics selected forward Kevin McHale in the draft and acquired center Robert Parish from the Golden State Warriors,[24][25] forming a Hall of Fame trio for years to come; the frontcourt of Bird, McHale, and Parish is regarded as one of the greatest frontcourts in NBA history.[26][27][28] Behind Bird's leadership and Boston's upgraded roster, the Celtics again advanced to the Conference Finals for a rematch with the 76ers.[29] Boston fell behind 3–1 to start the series but won the next three games to advance to the Finals against the Houston Rockets,[30] winning in six games and earning Bird his first championship.[29] He averaged 21.9 points, 14 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the postseason and 15.3 points, 15.3 rebounds, and 7 assists per game for the Finals but lost out on the Finals MVP Award to teammate Cedric Maxwell.[15][31] At the 1982 All-Star Game, Bird scored 19 points en route to winning the All-Star Game MVP Award.[32] At the conclusion of the season, he earned his first All-Defensive Team selection.[15] He eventually finished runner-up in Most Valuable Player Award voting to Moses Malone.[32] In the Conference Finals, the Celtics faced the 76ers for the third consecutive year, losing in seven games.[33] Boston's misfortunes continued into the next season, with Bird again finishing second in MVP voting to Malone and the team losing in the Conference Semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks.[32][34] Bird was named MVP of the 1983–84 season with averages of 24.2 points, 10.1 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game.[15] In the playoffs, the Celtics avenged their loss from the year before to the Bucks, winning in five games in the Conference Finals to advance to the Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers.[35] In Game Four, the Lakers—led by Bird's college rival Magic Johnson—were on the verge of taking a commanding 3-1 series lead before a flagrant foul was committed on Kurt Rambis that resulted in a brawl and caused the Lakers to lose their composure.[36] Boston came back to win the game, eventually winning the series in seven.[35] Bird was named Finals MVP behind 27.4 points, 14 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game.[35] On December 9, 1984, Bird recorded 48 points to go along with 14 rebounds and 5 assists in a 128-127 win over the Atlanta Hawks.[37] On March 12 of the 1984–85 season, Bird scored a career-high and franchise record 60 points in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[38] The performance came just nine days after Kevin McHale set the previous Celtics record for points in a game with 56.[39] At the conclusion of the year, Bird was named MVP for the second consecutive season behind averages of 28.7 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game.[15] Boston advanced through the playoffs to earn a rematch with the Lakers, this time losing in six games.[40] In the summer of 1985, Larry injured his back shoveling crushed rock to create a driveway at his mother's house. At least partially as a result of this, he experienced back problems for the remainder of his career.[41] Before the start of the 1985–86 season, the Celtics made a daring trade for Bill Walton, an All-Star center with a history of injury.[42] The risk paid off; Walton's acquisition helped Boston win a league best 67 games.[43] One of Bird's career highlights occurred at the 1986 NBA All-Star Weekend when he walked into the locker room at the inaugural Three-Point Shootout and asked who was going to finish second before winning the shootout.[44][45] On November 27, 1985, Bird recorded 47 points to go along with 12 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in a 132–124 win over the Detroit Pistons.[46] On March 10, 1986, Bird scored 50 points to go along with 11 rebounds and 5 assists in a 115–116 loss to the Dallas Mavericks.[47] With averages of 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists, and 2 steals per game, Bird became just the third player in NBA history to win three consecutive MVP Awards.[48] In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals.[42] In Game 6 of the Finals series, Bird recorded a triple-double of 29 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists as the Celtics won the Finals series 4 games to 2 against the Rockets.[49] Bird averaged 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 9.5 assists per game for the championship round. [50] The '86 Celtics are commonly ranked as one of the greatest basketball teams of all-time, with the Boston Globe's Peter May and Grantland's Bill Simmons listing them at number one.[51] In 1987, the Celtics made their last Finals appearance of Bird's career, fighting through difficult series against the Milwaukee Bucks and Detroit Pistons. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pistons, with five seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston trailing the Pistons 107–106, Bird stole an inbound pass. Falling out of bounds, Bird turned and passed the ball to teammate Dennis Johnson, who converted a game-winning 2-point layup with less than a second left. The dramatic play saved the series for the Celtics. When they reached the NBA Finals, the Celtics—hampered by devastating injuries—lost to a dominant Lakers team which had won 65 games during the season. The Celtics ended up losing to the Lakers in six games, with Bird averaging 24.2 points on .445 shooting, 10 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game in the championship series.[52] The Celtics would fall short in 1988 losing to the Detroit Pistons in 6 games in the Eastern Conference Finals as the Pistons made up from the heartbreak the previous season. Between them, Bird and Johnson captured eight NBA championships during the 1980s, with Magic getting five and Bird three. During the 1980s, either Boston or Los Angeles appeared in every NBA Finals.[53] Throughout the 1980s, contests between the Celtics and the Lakers—both during the regular season and in the Finals—attracted enormous television audiences. The first regular season game between the Celtics and the Lakers in the 1987–88 season proved to be a classic with Magic Johnson banking in an off balance shot from near the three-point line at the buzzer for a 115–114 Lakers win at Boston Garden.[54] The historical rift between the teams, which faced each other several times in championship series of the 1960s, fueled fan interest in the rivalry. Not since Bill Russell squared off against Wilt Chamberlain had professional basketball enjoyed such a marquee matchup. The apparent contrast between the two players and their respective teams seemed scripted for television: Bird, the introverted small-town hero with the blue-collar work ethic, fit perfectly with the throwback, hard-nosed style of the Celtics, while the stylish, gregarious Johnson ran the Lakers' fast-paced Showtime offense amidst the bright lights and celebrities of Los Angeles. A 1980s Converse commercial for its ""Weapon"" line of basketball shoes (endorsed by both Bird and Johnson) reflected the perceived dichotomy between the two players. In the commercial, Bird is practicing alone on a rural basketball court (in reality the court was one Bird had had made on the property in French Lick that he had purchased for his mother), when Johnson pulls up in a sleek limousine and challenges him to a one-on-one match.[citation needed] Despite the intensity of their rivalry, Bird and Johnson became friends off the court. Their friendship blossomed when the two players worked together to film the Converse commercial, which depicted them as archenemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony on February 4, 1993 and emotionally described Bird as a ""friend forever"".[citation needed] The 1987-1988 season was the highest-scoring season of Bird's career. In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals against the Atlanta Hawks, Bird shot 9 of 10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory over Atlanta. Bird finished with 34 points. His effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins. Wilkins remarked, ""The basket was like a well. I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played."" The Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference Finals. Bird's 1988–89 season season ended after six games when he had bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels. He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, during the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. In his final three seasons with the Celtics, Bird averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists per game, shot better than 45% from the field, and led the Celtics to playoff appearances. After leading the Celtics to a 29–5 start to the 1990–91 season, Bird missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that would eventually lead to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc from his back, but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the 1991–92 season. During the 1992 Eastern Conference semi-finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Bird missed four of the seven games due to recurring back problems. On August 18, 1992, Bird announced his retirement. Following Bird's departure, the Celtics promptly retired his jersey number 33. In the summer of 1992, Bird joined Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and other NBA stars to play for the United States basketball team in that year's Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.[55] It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent professional basketball players to compete. The ""Dream Team"" won the men's basketball gold medal. The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame called the team ""the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet"".[56] Bird was voted to the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996,[57][58] was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998,[59][60] and was inducted into the Hall of Fame again in 2010 as a member of the ""Dream Team"".[61] In 1999, Bird ranked No. 30 on ESPN SportsCentury's list of 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th century. He played both the small forward and power forward positions.[62] Bird has been described as one of the greatest basketball players and greatest shooters of all time.[64][65][66] He was selected to 12 NBA All-Star teams.[67] Bird won three NBA championships (in 1981, 1984, and 1986) with the Celtics[62] and won two NBA Finals MVP Awards.[68] Bird won three consecutive regular-season MVP awards; as of 2016, the only other players to accomplish this feat are Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain.[69] Bird is also remembered as one of the foremost clutch performers in the history of the NBA; he was known for his excellent play in high-stakes, high-pressure situations.[70][71][72] Bird scored 24.3 points per game in his career on a .496 field goal percentage, an .886 free throw percentage, and a 37.6 percentage on three-point shots. Bird had an average of 10.0 rebounds per game for his career and 6.3 assists.[73] Bird was the first player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws in a single NBA season while achieving the league minimum for makes in each category.[74] He accomplished this feat twice.[75] Bird won NBA three-point-shooting contests in three consecutive years.[76] He sometimes practiced shooting three-point shots with his eyes closed.[73] Bird is also remembered as an excellent passer[77] and defender.[62] While he was relatively slow, Bird displayed a knack for anticipating the moves of his opponent, making him a strong team defender.[64] He had 1,556 career steals.[78] In recognition of his defensive abilities, Bird was named to three All-Defensive Second Teams.[64] Bird was widely considered one of Red Auerbach's favorite players. He considered Bird to be the greatest basketball player of all time.[79][80] Bird's humble roots were the source of his most frequently used moniker, ""The Hick from French Lick"".[81] Bird was also referred to as ""The Great White Hope""[13] and ""Larry Legend"".[82] Bird was known for his trash-talking on the court.[83][84] At the 2019 NBA Awards, Bird received the NBA Lifetime Achievement Award (shared with Magic Johnson).[85] The Celtics employed Bird as a special assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997.[86] In 1997, Bird accepted the position of coach of the Indiana Pacers[87] and said he would be on the job for no more than three years.[88] Despite having no previous coaching experience, Bird led the Pacers to a 58–24 record—the franchise's best as an NBA team at the time—in the 1997–98 season,[89] and pushed the Chicago Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals.[89] He was named the NBA Coach of the Year for his efforts.[90] Bird then led the Pacers to consecutive Central Division titles in 1999 and 2000 and a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals.[89] Bird resigned his head coaching position shortly after the end of the 2000 season, following through on his initial promise to coach for only three years.[91] In 2003, Bird was hired as the Pacers' President of Basketball Operations.[92] After the 2011–2012 NBA season, Bird was named NBA Executive of the Year, becoming the only man in NBA history to win the NBA MVP, Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year.[93] On June 27, 2012, a day before the 2012 NBA draft, Bird and the Pacers announced that they would be parting ways; Bird said that health issues were among the reasons for his departure.[94] Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013.[2] He stepped down again in 2017, but stayed with the team in an advisory capacity.[95] As player: As coach: As executive: Bird married Dinah Mattingly in 1989. They have two adopted children, Conner and Mariah. Bird also has a biological daughter, Corrie, from his first marriage to high school classmate Janet Condra. He has four brothers, Mike, Mark, Jeff and Eddie, and a sister, Linda. Eddie also played basketball at Indiana State from 1986 to 1990.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/26.png

Blair worked twenty seasons in the National Basketball Association, beginning in New Jersey with the New Jersey Nets, and continuing to the Chicago Bulls, under Kevin Loughery, helping to draft Michael Jordan. He then moved to the Washington Bullets under Wes Unseld, and next the Indiana Pacers under Larry Brown—coaching spectacular teams with Reggie Miller at the helm. In 1993, he became the head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, then went back to the Pacers, and finally finished his career under Randy Whitman (current Washington Wizards coach) at the Cleveland Cavaliers.[2] Blair is a 1960 graduate of Randolph-Macon Academy where he starred on the best basketball team the school ever had.[citation needed] He made the starting 5 as a sophomore and was the high scorer his senior year in a season when they lost only one game which he and three other starters missed. When next they played the same school they doubled their opponent's point total.[citation needed] He scored 49 points in one game which is the school record. He played college ball at VMI where he led them to their first NCAA appearance in 32 years as their high scorer. In 1964 Blair was drafted by the St. Louis Hawks in the 14th round.[3] While in the Army serving in Korea, he played AND coached the 8th Army Division team which won the Korean championship and the Asian-Pacific Championship in Okinawa. He toured with the Army All Star team.[citation needed] After two stints at Virginia high schools, he went back to VMI as an assistant, then a head coach.

28,David Blatt,"May 22, 1959",,,Princeton,2015,2016,2,true,,"""[6]""",/coaches/blattda99c.html,"David Michael Blatt (Hebrew: דיוויד מייקל בלאט‎; born May 22, 1959), is an Israeli American professional basketball executive. He is also a former coach and player. Blatt played point guard at Princeton University from 1977 to 1981 and played in the Maccabiah Games for the USA national team that won a gold medal in 1981. He then played professional basketball in Israel for nine of the next twelve years, before an injury ended his playing career, and he began coaching full-time. He is one of the most successful American coaches in European basketball history. As a coach, Blatt has been the Israeli Super League Coach of the Year four times (1996, 2002, 2011, and 2014), the Russian Super League Coach of the Year (2005), and the EuroLeague Coach of the Year (2014). Blatt took over as Cleveland's head coach, and led the team to the 2015 NBA Finals in his first season. He guided them to the top of their conference the next year, but was fired mid-season, and subsequently returned to coaching in Europe. Blatt was born in Boston, grew up in Framingham, Massachusetts, and is Jewish.[1] As a boy, he went to a Reform Temple, and until his Bar Mitzvah he attended Hebrew school twice a week.[1] He says that in Israel he became ""much more Jewish and much more Zionist.""[1] In his sophomore year at Princeton, a coach for an Israeli kibbutz team recruited him to play in Israel for the summer.[2] The summer at Kibbutz Gan Shmuel turned out to be a life-changing experience.[3] Blatt graduated from Princeton in 1981 with a B.A. in English literature, completing his senior thesis on Bernard Malamud, author of The Natural.[4] In 1981 he immigrated to Israel, and served in the Israel Defense Forces on the Schneller military base.[1][5] In 1991 Blatt married Kinneret, from Netanya, Israel; she had played on an Israeli professional basketball team that he coached.[3][6] They have four children: twin daughters Shani and Adi (who have served in the Israeli army), daughter Ela (his youngest child), and son Tamir Blatt (born in 1997; in 2014 he was the starting point guard on the Israeli junior national basketball team, and has played for Hapoel Tel Aviv, Hapoel Holon and Hapoel Jerusalem).[3][6][7][8][9][10][11] On August 19, 2019, he announced that he has PPMS.[12] Blatt played basketball at Framingham South High School, where he was also class president.[3][7] A point guard, Blatt played college basketball at Princeton University from 1977 to 1981 under coach Pete Carril with the Princeton Tigers, where he was team captain.[13] He also participated in the Maccabiah Games as part of the USA national team that won a gold medal in 1981.[2] After competing in the Maccabiah, Blatt began to play professional basketball in Israel's Super League, and played 9 of the next 12 years in Israel before an injury ended his playing career and he started coaching full-time.[7][14] After retiring from basketball as a player, Blatt became assistant manager for Hapoel Galil Elyon, coaching them for the 1993–94 season. In the middle of the season, the head coach was fired and Blatt took his place. The following year, he became Pini Gershon's assistant for the 1994–95 season. The next year, he won the title of Israeli ""Coach of the Year"" for 1996. In 1997, he continued coaching Hapoel Galil Elyon, while also becoming the assistant coach of the Israeli National Team. For six years, he coached Russian national basketball team, winning the EuroBasket 2007. Blatt returned to coach Galil Elyon, and remained assistant manager of the Israeli National Team for the next two years (1997–99). During his time in Galil Elyon Blatt notoriously assisted Pini Gershon, then head coach of Maccabi Tel Aviv, by relaying directions laid out during live broadcasts on national television of time outs of their rivals in the Israeli league finals series games.[15] For the 1999–2000 season, he moved to Maccabi Tel Aviv, and once again served as assistant manager to Pini Gershon. During that season, his team took part in the Israeli League and Israeli Cup (winning both), and also in the EuroLeague, where Maccabi finished in 2nd place. In the years between 2000–04, he continued as assistant coach under Pini Gershon and actively recruited foreign players such as Anthony Parker (in 2000) and Maceo Baston to the team. During those four years, Maccabi won one EuroLeague title, reached the EuroLeague Final Four (2001–02 season), and reached the final stage of the Adriatic League. Maccabi won the SuproLeague title in 2001 in Paris. Blatt was still working as assistant coach of the Israeli National Team in 2002, when he won the title of Israeli ""Coach of the Year"" for the second time, the year he was appointed head coach of Maccabi Tel Aviv. Despite two years as head coach with all possible domestic titles and one EuroLeague Final Four appearance, for the 2003–04 season, he agreed to be demoted to assistant coach once again when Pini Gershon came back to the head coach position. Together they led one of the best teams in Maccabi Tel Aviv history, and the history of European basketball, to another EuroLeague title with a 44-point win in the final, as well as to the Israeli Championship and the Israeli Cup. In 2004, he moved to Russia and signed on as head coach with Dynamo Saint Petersburg. During that year, he won the FIBA EuroCup championship with Dynamo and also the title of ""Coach of the Year in Russia"" (2004–05 season). For the 2005–06 season, he signed on as head coach of the Israeli national basketball team, but his appointment fell through due to the lack of a formal coaching certificate. He left Israel to become head coach of Benetton Treviso of the Italian League, and subsequently led them to the Italian Championship with a 3–1 victory in the final series of the Italian playoffs. In the same year, he was also appointed the head coach of the Russian national basketball team. At the beginning of the 2007–08 season, Blatt was appointed as a head coach of the Istanbul-based Turkish Super League team Efes Pilsen. However, on April 6, 2008, he parted ways with the team, due to poor results over the season.[16] Blatt also coached the Russian national basketball team, with which he won the EuroBasket 2007 in a final game against the reigning world champions and home team of Spain, by a score of 60–59.[17][18] In 2008, with Ettore Messina announcing that he would leave CSKA Moscow, Blatt was considered to be the favorite to replace him, but Messina eventually stayed on as CSKA's coach and Blatt agreed to the offer to become the head coach of Dynamo Moscow instead.[19] Although under contract for two seasons, he parted ways with the team, after requesting that from the team in order to pursue his career elsewhere.[20] In early 2010, Blatt served a stint as the head coach of the Greek League club Aris, before moving on to coach Maccabi Tel Aviv once again.[21] Blatt led the Russian national team to a bronze medal during the 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2014, Blatt led Maccabi Tel Aviv to one of the greatest comebacks against CSKA Moscow in the EuroLeague semifinal game, proceeding to win the championship after beating Real Madrid in overtime.[22] In June, after his contract ended, Blatt officially parted ways with the club in order to seek an NBA coaching position.[23] Over six seasons as Maccabi head coach, he compiled a 179–21 (.895) record in the Israeli League, and a record of 90–52 (.634) in the EuroLeague, for an overall record of 269–73 combined (.787). In 9 seasons, his career coaching record in the EuroLeague with Maccabi, Treviso, and Efes was 121–81 (.599).[24] On June 20, 2014, Blatt was hired as head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers.[25] Following his signing with the Cavaliers, Blatt was named the EuroLeague Coach of the Year.[26] On April 1, 2015, Blatt earned his first Eastern Conference Coach of the Month award.[27] The Cavaliers led the Eastern Conference in March in points-per-game (107.0), points-per-game differential (9.1), field goal percentage (.469), three-point field goal percentage (.399) and three-pointers made per game (12.3). The Cavaliers were also 5–0 at home and tied for the most road wins in the East at 6–4. The month also saw the Cavaliers extend their winning streak at Quicken Loans Arena to 16 games (January 19 – March 29), which tied for the third-longest home streak in franchise history. Over the season, the Cavaliers led the Central Division with a 53–29 record, and Blatt's lifetime .639 winning percentage after the 2014–15 season was the best of any Cavaliers coach in team history.[28] During the Eastern Conference Semifinals, Blatt attempted to call a timeout when the Cavs did not have any left. This would have given the Cavaliers a technical foul, but the referees did not see the attempted timeout and the Cavaliers won the game, tying the series 2–2, and eventually winning the series. In Blatt's first season, the Cavaliers won the Eastern Conference title, their first since 2007.[29] Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Blatt to congratulate him on bringing the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals.[30][31] While other rookie head coaches have reached the NBA Finals, Blatt and rival coach Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors were the first pair of rookie NBA coaches to face each other in the NBA Finals since the first year of the NBA's existence, in 1947.[32] The Cavaliers eventually lost 4–2 to the Warriors in the Finals.[33] On January 22, 2016, the Cavaliers fired Blatt.[34] Although the team held the best record in their conference (30–11), general manager David Griffin cited ""a lack of fit with our personnel and our vision"" as the reason for the decision.[35] Blatt was replaced by his lead assistant Tyronn Lue, who guided the Cavaliers to their first NBA championship that season. Even though Blatt only coached the first half of the championship season, the Cavaliers' officials sent him a 2016 NBA Championship ring. At first he declined their offer but later changed his mind and accepted it.[36] On June 1, 2016, Blatt was named the new head coach for Darüşşafaka of the Turkish Super League and the EuroLeague.[37] In his first season with Darüşşafaka, Blatt coached the team to the EuroLeague quarterfinals, where they eventually lost 1–3 to Real Madrid. In the Turkish Super League, Darüşşafaka was eliminated in the semifinals by Fenerbahçe. In his second season with Darüşşafaka, Blatt won the 2018 EuroCup Championship, becoming only the second coach in history (after Dusan Ivkovic) who won Euroleague (with Maccabi in 2014), EuroBasket (with Russia in 2007), EuroCup and Olympic medals (bronze with Russia in 2012).[38] On June 27, 2018, Blatt was officially named the head coach for Olympiacos of the Greek Basket League and the EuroLeague, signing a two-year contract.[39] On October 6, 2019, Blatt parted ways with Olympiacos after one season.[40] On December 18, 2019, Blatt announced his retirement from coaching after the New York Knicks hired him as consultant.[41][42][43] Note: The EuroLeague is not the only competition in which the team played during the season. He also coached in domestic competition, and regional competition if applicable.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/28.png

He served as the general manager and head coach of the New Orleans Hornets. Bower held the Hornets head coaching position during most of the 2009–10 season, and the general manager position twice, in 2002–03 and from 2005 to 2010. Bower helped rebuild the Hornets, despite the troubles Hurricane Katrina placed on the club and the city of New Orleans in general. He took a giant step in re-writing Hornets history by trading franchise piece Baron Davis to the Warriors, then selecting guard Chris Paul fourth overall in the 2005 NBA draft. The disaster Katrina caused forced the Hornets to move to Oklahoma City until the 2007–08 NBA season, but Bower continued to build his club. Through trade, draft, and signings, the Hornets actually competed in their two seasons in Oklahoma with a 38–44 record in 2005–06 and 39–43 in 2006–07. Yet again, another series of trials and tribulations, the Hornets improved and contended. Injuries to Paul (for 18 games), Peja Stojaković (for sixty-nine), and scoring big man David West (for thirty) dampened the opportunity to make the playoffs.[2] For 2007–08, the Hornets came back home to open arms. They broke out, with the dangerous roster of Tyson Chandler (whom Bower traded for in 2006 for J. R. Smith), Paul, Stojakovic, West, and new acquisition Morris Peterson (from Toronto), with pieces like 3-point specialists Rasual Butler and Jannero Pargo (the former acquired in a 2005 trade, the latter left prior to the 2008–09 NBA season) and rebounders Melvin Ely and Ryan Bowen; and developing youth such as Julian Wright and Hilton Armstrong (both draft picks of the Hornets). The general of it all was Coach of the Year Byron Scott prior to the 2004–05 NBA season, and the Hornets won 56 games, their first divisional title, and were labeled ""contender"" by many analysts.[3][4] Bower's performance in spearheading the Hornets from lottery team to contender gave him 12 votes from the sportswriters for the Sporting News NBA Executive of the Year, behind Lakers' GM Mitch Kupchak and winner, Boston Celtics' Danny Ainge.[5] Bower helped draft David West, J. R. Smith, Chris Paul, Darren Collison and Marcus Thornton. Bower had been with the organization for 14 years, beginning in 1995–96,[6] director of scouting, director of player personnel, as a scout, GM (in 2002–03), and assistant to former coaches Paul Silas and Tim Floyd.[2] Bowers served as an advance scout for the Charlotte Hornets in 1995–97 and the Hornets Director of Scouting in 1997–2009. He also was an associate head coach at Marist College from 1990–95, prior to that, being an assistant coach at both Marist and Penn State University.[2] On November 12, 2009, Bower was made the head coach of the team after the firing of Byron Scott.[7] He led the team to a 34–39 record despite injury problems in the team. At the end of the season, he stepped down from the coaching duty and returned to his position as a general manager.[8] He was replaced by Monty Williams. Bower and the Hornets parted ways on July 13, 2010.[9] On April 10, 2013 it was announced that he will take over as coach of the Marist College men's basketball team.[10] Bower served as an assistant coach for the Red Foxes from 1986 to 1990 and served as the Associate Head Coach from 1990 to 1995.

As a player Brovelli was a three-year letterman for USF, helping lead the Dons to the NCAA Western Regional in 1963 and 1964. He earned All-WCC honorable mention honors in 1964. Later, he was named the 1965 AAU Athlete of the Year. He became the Dons head coach in 1984. Starting from scratch after USF's self-imposed three-year hiatus stemming from various NCAA recruiting violations incurred during the Quintin Dailey era, Brovelli led the Dons for ten seasons, including a 19-win campaign in 1993. His greatest victory as USF head coach came in 1988 when USF achieved a stunning upset of Digger Phelps and Notre Dame in front of a sellout crowd in USF's Memorial Gymnasium. He finished with 131 career victories at USF. Prior to his USF stint he was the head coach for the University of San Diego Toreros from 1973 to 1984, successfully guiding their transition from NCAA Division II power to the Division I ranks. He took the Division II program to three NCAA Western Regionals, winning the championship in 1977–1978 and advancing to the Final Four while earning District VIII Coach of the Year honors. His final three years of coaching the Division II program saw the teams go 20–7, 22–7, and 19-7. Brovelli guided USD's move to the Division I West Coast Conference in 1979. His programs improved each year in the win column, and during his final year (1983–1984) at USD, he directed the Toreros to the program's first WCC championship and first appearance in the NCAA Division I Tournament. That season the Toreros finished 18-10 overall and 9-3 in league play, and Brovelli earned WCC Coach of the Year honors. At the time of his departure from San Diego he had 160 career victories and was the winningest men's basketball coach in USD history (since surpassed by Brad Holland). After departing USF he was named Director of Player Development with the Denver Nuggets on February 1, 1996. Later that following season he added Assistant Coach duties for the Nuggets. Brovelli joined long-time friend, Bernie Bickerstaff, in 1998–99 as assistant coach, and on April 6, 1999, was named interim head coach of the Washington Wizards. He coached the final 18 games of the 1999 lockout-shortened season. He next coached the Sioux Falls Skyforce in the Continental Basketball Association from 1999–2000, where he led the 'Force to a record of 30-26 and a playoff appearance. Brovelli then signed on as a scout with the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats. He has also coached the Japanese National Team and was a volunteer coach for the Minnesota Timberwolves for a season, in addition to serving as a member of the NCAA Recruiting Committee and Academic Committee. More recently he was named Director of Athletics at College of Marin, while simultaneously providing radio color commentary for the USF Dons men's basketball home games. Brovelli received his degree in Business Administration from the University of San Francisco in 1964 and his Masters from the University of the Pacific in 1966. Brovelli is a long-time resident of San Rafael, CA with his wife, Nada. Their son, Mike (USF '95), was a Dons basketball standout, and their daughter, Michele (USD '96), was a Toreros basketball standout.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/37.png

He is the current head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Australia national team. Brown is a former college basketball player who previously served as an assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs. He also has extensive experience coaching in Australia, having been the head coach of the North Melbourne Giants and Sydney Kings of the NBL and the Australia men's national team. Born and raised in Maine, Brown first played organized basketball in Rockland, was a star guard in junior high school there, and then his father was hired as the head coach.[1] Brown transferred to South Portland where he became a star basketball player at South Portland High School, from which he graduated in 1979.[2] Brown was a two-year first-team all-state guard in 1978 and 1979, and led his team to a 27–0 record and a State Class A Title in his senior year.[2] Both Brown and his father, Bob Brown, who was South Portland's head coach during Brown's playing career, are inductees to the New England Basketball Hall of Fame.[3] Brown played four seasons at Boston University under Rick Pitino. He was named the Lou Cohen MVP in his sophomore year and served as the team captain in both his junior and senior seasons. During his senior year in 1983, the Boston Terriers made their first appearance in the NCAA Tournament since 1959.[2] By the time he graduated, Brown had compiled the fourth-most assists in school history.[3] After graduation, he served as a graduate assistant under coach John Kuester.[4] Brown also took a sales job with AT&T, saving enough money to take a backpacking trip to Oceania in 1987.[2] In 1988, after a coaching stint in New Zealand with Altos Auckland,[5] Brown made a cold call to Melbourne Tigers head coach Lindsay Gaze, ultimately leading to a job offer and Brown making Australia his home for the next 18 years.[2] He served as a Tigers assistant coach until 1993, when he became head coach of the North Melbourne Giants. Brown was named NBL coach of the year in 1994, when he led the Giants to a championship victory over the Adelaide 36ers. He served as head coach of the Giants until 1998, before taking a job with the San Antonio Spurs.[3] Following his stint with the Spurs, Brown coached the Sydney Kings from 2000 to 2002.[3][6] Overall, he was a head coach for 278 NBL games, winning 54 percent of the time.[7] After attending a basketball camp run by Brown and Andrew Gaze, San Antonio Spurs general manager R. C. Buford hired Brown as an unpaid member of the Spurs' basketball operations department for the 1998–99 lockout-shortened season.[2] In 2002, after a stint with the Sydney Kings, he again took a position with the Spurs, this time as the team's director of player development.[3] Buford credited him with focusing attention on the team's lesser-known players, creating a consistently strong bench; this philosophy would continue to benefit the Spurs even after Brown left his role as player development director.[8] He was promoted to as an assistant coach in September 2007, working under coach Gregg Popovich.[9] Popovich calls Brown ""one of his best friends,"" and Brown would later incorporate many of Popovich's concepts into his own offensive system.[10] He played a major role in signing Australian guard Patty Mills, who played under him for the Australian national team.[11] Brown was a member of the Spurs organization for four of their championship-winning seasons.[3] During the 2013 NBA off-season, Brown was offered a chance to succeed Mike Budenholzer as the top assistant on Gregg Popovich's staff, but in August 2013, he chose instead to become head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers.[12] He inherited a team in ""total rebuilding mode"" led by new general manager Sam Hinkie,[13] and the Sixers were only able to woo Brown away from the Spurs after offering a 4-year guaranteed contract.[14] His appointment made him the 24th head coach in the history of the franchise,[13] and the second person to be a head coach in both the NBL and the NBA, following Mike Dunlap. The Sixers were the youngest team in the league during Brown's first year, and one of the youngest of all time.[15] During the second half of the 2013–14 season, the Sixers would lose 26 games in a row, tying the record for longest NBA losing streak.[16] Sixers point guard Michael Carter-Williams won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in 2014, and credited Brown for helping him win the award and grow as a player.[17] On December 11, 2015, the 76ers signed Brown to a contract extension.[18] On May 31, 2018, the 76ers signed Brown to another contract extension, coming off their first playoff appearance since 2012. On June 7, 2018, Brown was named interim general manager after Bryan Colangelo resigned after a social media scandal, where he criticized team members.[19][20][21] Brown was an assistant coach of the Australia national team between 1995 and 2003, serving during the 1998 FIBA World Championship and the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics.[11] He was hired in 2009 to serve as head coach of the team, and held that position until 2012.[11] Under Brown, Australia finished 10th in the 2010 FIBA World Championship.[11] In the 2012 Summer Olympics, he led Australia to the Quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by the United States national team, who won the tournament.[3] On November 27, 2019, Brown returned to Australia national team as head coach replacing Andrej Lemanis.[22][23] Brown met and married his wife, Anna, in Australia.

He is the former head coach of the Detroit Pistons (1976–78). Brown was named head coach of the NBA's Detroit Pistons during the 1975-76 NBA season, replacing Ray Scott, who'd gone 17-25. The 39-year-old Brown, who'd been an assistant to Scott in Detroit, went 19-21 in his first season with the Pistons, who won 10 of their last 11 games of the regular season. He then guided the team into the second round of the NBA playoffs where the Pistons lost to Golden State, four games to two. The following season, the Pistons went 44-38 under Brown, before losing in the first round of the playoffs to the Golden State Warriors. The Pistons fired Brown on December 15, 1977, after a 9-15 start to the 1977-78 NBA season, replacing him with the team's 32-year-old general manager, Bob Kauffman, who went 29-29 as head coach. In 1978, Brown was named head coach of the Tucson Gunners, a franchise in the newly formed Western Basketball Association (WBA). He was named WBA Coach of the Year after guiding the team to a 32-16 record and the league championship, where Tucson beat Reno (which was coached by Bill Musselman), four games to three. Brown was head coach of the Puerto Rico Coquis of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) from 1983–85, going 28-16 and 27-21, in 1983-84 and 1984–85, respectively. He earned CBA Coach of the Year honors following the 1983-84 season. He also coached the Cincinnati Slammers of the CBA in 1985-86. In June 1990, Brown was named head coach and vice president of basketball operations for the Baltimore BayRunners of the International Basketball League (IBL). He was fired after going 10-20 in the team's inaugural season. The BayRunners won just seven more games after firing Brown to finish the season at 17-47. The Bobcats are Brown's third team on which he has served under brother Larry. Together, they helped coach the Pistons to the NBA championship in 2004, and led the Philadelphia 76ers to the 2001 NBA Finals. Brown has also served as an assistant coach for several teams, including the Portland Trail Blazers, Houston Rockets, Indiana Pacers, Phoenix Suns, and Atlanta Hawks. He also coached overseas, most notably in Spain in the early 1990s. At the college level, Brown was head basketball coach at Stony Brook University from 1964–69, earning Coach of the Year honors following the 1969 season. Brown served as head coach at C.W. Post (of Long Island University) from 1972–74, going 21-5 and 13-12 over two seasons. On September 3, 2014, Brown was named an assistant coach at Portland.[1] Born in Brooklyn, New York, Brown is a graduate of the University of Vermont. The author of three books about basketball, he runs a Basketball Academy in the summer at the New Jersey Y Camps. In 2006, he was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum.

Brown is a two-time NBA Coach of the Year, the honors being separated by 26 years. Brown was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005. Born in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, Brown moved to Elizabeth, New Jersey at age three and was raised there, living in a small apartment building without a telephone.[1] Brown, an only child, has said that his father, Charlie, who worked at the shipyards, was a ""demanding man.""[1] He graduated from St. Mary of the Assumption High School in 1951. While in high school, St. Mary won state championships in football, basketball and baseball.[2] Hubie Brown played college basketball and baseball at Niagara University, graduating in 1955 with a degree in education. While at Niagara, Brown was a teammate (and roommate) of former Utah Jazz coach Frank Layden, as well as Larry Costello and Charlie Hoxie, who would go on to star for the Harlem Globetrotters.[1] After leaving Niagara, Brown joined the U.S. Army where he joined the Army's basketball team.[3] After being honorably discharged in 1958, Brown briefly played for the Rochester Colonels of the Eastern Professional Basketball League (the forerunner to the Continental Basketball Association) before they folded after just eight games. He averaged 13.8 points per game in his brief stint as a pro and was an excellent defender as a player. Brown also returned to Niagara to earn a master's degree in education as he looked to pursue a coaching career.[3] Brown's defensive mentality would carry on into his coaching career, which began in 1955 at St. Mary Academy in Little Falls,[4] New York where he coached both basketball and baseball. He spent nine years coaching at the high school level, including Cranford High School in Cranford, New Jersey and Fair Lawn High School in Fair Lawn, New Jersey before becoming an assistant coach for one season at the College of William and Mary in 1968. The following season, Brown joined Duke University as an assistant coach. Brown coached at Duke until 1972, when he joined the NBA as an assistant coach for the Milwaukee Bucks under Larry Costello. Milwaukee made the NBA Finals in 1974 with future Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson, but fell in seven games to the Boston Celtics, who were led by their own superstars: Dave Cowens, John Havlicek, Jo Jo White and future Bucks coach Don Nelson. After two seasons in the NBA, Brown was given his first professional head coaching opportunity with the Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association. Brown led the Colonels to the 1975 ABA Championship. Brown continued as the Colonels' coach until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976 when the Colonels franchise folded, one of two ABA teams that did not join the NBA (the Spirits of St. Louis being the other). Brown then rejoined the NBA as head coach of the Atlanta Hawks, going 31-51 in his first season with the Hawks. But by the 1977-78 season, the Hawks had rebounded into a .500 team, finishing 41-41 and earning Coach of the Year honors for Brown. Two years later, in 1979-80, they won only their second division title since moving to Atlanta. However, after they tumbled to a 31-win season in 1980-81, Brown was fired with just three games remaining in the season.[5] Brown continued to coach the Hawks, leading them to a Central Division Title in the 1979-80 season, before joining the New York Knicks in 1982, succeeding long-time coach Red Holzman. He stayed with the Knicks until he was fired in 1986 after starting the season 4-12. After reaching the playoffs in each of Brown's first two seasons, the Knicks plummeted to 24-58 in 1984-85 and 23-59 in 1985-86. But there were circumstances that were far beyond Brown's control that hastened the downfall. Star forward Bernard King suffered a devastating knee injury in March 1985 in a game against the Kansas City Kings, not fully recovering for two seasons, while Patrick Ewing, the top overall pick in the 1985 NBA Draft, missed 32 games in an injury-plagued rookie season. Brown left the Knicks at the beginning of the 1986-87 season, succeeded by Bob Hill.[6] Sixteen years removed from his previous NBA coaching job, Brown was again tapped to be a head coach in the NBA 2002-03 season by Jerry West of the Memphis Grizzlies, who fired coach Sidney Lowe after an 0-8 start. The Grizzlies' choice of Brown was quite controversial at the time; Hubie Brown was the oldest coach in the NBA at the age of 69.[7] Brown finished the season with a 28-46 record with the team, at the time the team's record for wins. However, the team underwent a complete turnaround for the 2003-04 season, finishing 50-32 and making the playoffs for the first time in team history. Brown was again named the NBA's Coach of the Year. However, by the 2004-05 season, there were again concerns about Brown's health and age. Brown was given medical clearance to start the season, but was forced to delegate much work to his assistant coaches, including his son, Brendan Brown. This led to an incident between Brendan Brown and Jason Williams when Williams snapped at Brown during the fourth quarter of a game early on in the season. Williams eventually apologized, but the Grizzlies were beginning to struggle during the season, starting 5-7. Brown then unexpectedly resigned from the Grizzlies on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 2004. In a statement, he cited ""unexpected health-related issues... [that were] absolutely nonexistent at the beginning of the season."" Details of the specific ""health-related issues"" were not announced. Shortly afterward Mike Fratello was announced as the new Grizzlies coach, marking the second time in his career that he had succeeded Brown at an NBA head coaching position.[8] Soon after Brown's unexpected departure, it was reported by Ronald Tillery of the Memphis The Commercial Appeal that a combination of negative attitudes among James Posey, Jason Williams, and Bonzi Wells led to his leaving. Brown coached his team with a 10-man rotation, which meant that players got smaller amounts of playing time. Brown began broadcasting after being fired by the Hawks, working for USA Network's coverage of the NBA, including playoff games as well as CBS before being hired by the Knicks. During the 1985 NBA playoffs, Brown lent his services for CBS once again while still coaching the Knicks, who were not in the playoffs, teamed up with Brent Musburger. Following his dismissal from the Knicks, CBS hired Brown full-time as a broadcaster in December 1986, and served alongside Verne Lundquist as the third team during select regular season and playoff games, promoted to the second team the next season. When asked in 1988 how long he will remain involved with the game of basketball, Brown responded ""I will stay involved in some capacity until the day Verne Lundquist dies."" In 1988, CBS named Brown to replace Billy Cunningham as its lead analyst alongside play-by-play man Dick Stockton. Brown remained with CBS until the end of their NBA coverage following the 1990 NBA Finals, then worked on the local broadcasts for the Philadelphia 76ers and the Detroit Pistons before joining TNT in the early 1990s. Brown continued anchoring TNT's basketball coverage through the 2001-02 season, in which he was paired with various announcers such as Bob Neal, Ron Thulin, Pete Van Wieren, and his old CBS partners Verne Lundquist and Dick Stockton. Shortly after his departure from the Grizzlies, Brown signed with ABC as their top NBA analyst. Brown worked with Al Michaels and Mike Breen on some regular-season and playoff games, including the 2005 NBA Finals and 2006 NBA Finals, before he was replaced as lead analyst by Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy. Brown currently calls games on ABC and ESPN working alongside such play-by-play announcers as Mark Jones and Mike Breen. He also contributes to ESPN Radio's coverage of the NBA playoffs and NBA Finals. Brown was nominated for a Sports Emmy in 1994 and 1999.[9] In 2005, Brown was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor.[10] Brown and his wife Claire have three daughters (Molly, Virginia, and Julie) and a son (Brendan), a former NBA scout and assistant coach who has worked for the New York Knicks as a radio analyst.[11] Brown also has three grandchildren.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/40.png

Brown is the only coach in basketball history to win both an NCAA national championship (Kansas Jayhawks, 1988) and an NBA title (Detroit Pistons, 2004). He has a 1,275-965 lifetime professional coaching record in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is the only coach in NBA history to lead eight teams to the playoffs. He also won an ABA championship as a player with the Oakland Oaks in the 1968–69 season, and an Olympic Gold Medal in 1964. He is also the only person ever to coach two NBA franchises in the same season (Spurs and Clippers during the 1991–92 NBA season).[1] Before coaching, Brown played collegiately at the University of North Carolina and professionally in the ABA. Brown was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach on September 27, 2002. Although widely considered one of the greatest coaches in basketball history, he has developed a reputation for constantly looking for better coaching opportunities and frequently switching teams or programs before the expiration of his contract.[2] Brown is Jewish,[3] and was born in Brooklyn, New York.[4] His maternal grandfather Hittelman was from Minsk, Belarus, and his mother's family immigrated to the United States in 1910 and opened a bakery in Brooklyn.[5] His mother met his father Milton Brown, a furniture salesman, when she was 26 years old.[5] He has an older brother, Herbert, who has been an NBA head coach.[5] In 1947 his father died suddenly of an aneurysm.[5] His family moved first to Brooklyn, then to Long Beach, New York, on Long Island.[5] His mother lived until the age of 106.[5] A 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) point guard, Brown attended Long Beach High School.[6] He won a gold medal with Team USA in basketball at the 1961 Maccabiah Games.[7] Brown attended University of North Carolina, where he played basketball under legendary coaches Frank McGuire and Dean Smith. Brown was an All-Atlantic Coast Conference player in 1963.[7] A stellar player for the Tar Heels in the early 1960s, Brown was considered too small to play in the NBA. He began his post-college career with the NABL's Akron Wingfoots, where he played for two years (1964–65). During that time, Brown was selected for the 1964 Summer Olympics team, on which he played and with which he won a gold medal,[3] while also leading the Wingfoots to the 1964 AAU National Championship. After a brief stint as an assistant coach at North Carolina, Brown joined the upstart American Basketball Association, playing with the New Orleans Buccaneers (1967–68), Oakland Oaks (1968–69), Washington Caps (1969–70), Virginia Squires (1970–71), and Denver Rockets (1971–72). Brown was named MVP of the ABA's first All-Star Game in 1968, and was named to the All-ABA Second Team the same year. Brown led the ABA in assists per game during the league's first three seasons, and when he ended his playing career, Brown was the ABA's all-time assist leader. His total of 2,509 assists places him seventh on the ABA's career list, and he holds the ABA record for assists in a game with 23.[8] He was a three-time ABA All-Star.[9] Brown's first head coaching job was at Davidson College in North Carolina in 1969. Unfortunately for Wildcat fans, it would only last during the summer offseason and he never coached a game.[10] Brown moved on to the ABA and coached with the Carolina Cougars and then the Denver Nuggets, who later joined the NBA in 1976, for five and a half seasons from 1974 to 1979. He then moved on to coach for UCLA (1979–1981), leading his freshman-dominated 1979–80 team to the NCAA title game before falling to Louisville, 59–54. However, that appearance was later vacated by the NCAA after two UCLA players were found to be ineligible—one of the few times a Final Four squad has had its record vacated. Brown was the head coach for the NBA's New Jersey Nets for two years following that, from 1981 to 1983. Brown began his tenure at the University of Kansas (1983–1988), replacing the fired Ted Owens, who had overseen back-to-back losing seasons in 1981-82 and 1982-83. Brown's impact was felt almost immediately, as the 1983-84 Jayhawks put together a 22-10 record, finished in second place in that year's Big 8 standings, upset Oklahoma to win the 1984 Big 8 Tournament, and advanced to the 1984 NCAA Tournament's Round of 32 before losing to Wake Forest. In the meantime Brown signed the most coveted high school player in the country, Danny Manning, to play for KU after signing his father, Ed Manning, to a position as an assistant coach. Perhaps Brown's finest team at Kansas was the 1985-86 team. This squad put together a 35-4 record, the first 30-win season in KU history. They won the Big 8 regular season title for the first time since 1978, defeated Iowa State to win the 1986 Big 8 Tournament, and advanced to the 1986 Final Four before losing to Duke in the semifinals. In the 1987-88 season, Kansas got off to a mediocre 12–8 start, including 1–4 in the Big 8, and the end of the Jayhawks' 55-game homecourt winning streak in Allen Fieldhouse. Ultimately, behind the high-scoring of Danny Manning, KU rallied to win nine of their next twelve games to finish third place in the Big 8 and qualify for the 1988 NCAA Tournament as a 6-seed in the Midwest Regional. Kansas then proceeded to defeat 11th-seed Xavier, 14th-seed Murray State, and 7th-seed Vanderbilt before meeting rival Kansas State, which had beaten KU twice in three meetings that year. KU upset the 4th-seeded Wildcats 71-58 in the Elite Eight to reach the Final Four in Kansas City's Kemper Arena. Once there, Kansas upset the East Region's #2 seed Duke, 66-59, avenging an overtime loss at home to the Blue Devils earlier in the season. Two nights later, the Jayhawks, who became known as ""Danny and the Miracles"", upset the Southeast Region's #1-seed and fellow Big 8 rival Oklahoma, 83-79, to avenge a regular-season sweep by the Sooners and win the 1988 NCAA championship. Manning, who scored 31 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in the final, was named Most Outstanding Player of the Tournament. Kansas concluded the year 27-11; the 11 losses remain a record for most losses by an NCAA champion to this day. Two months later, Brown opted to return to professional coaching, departing KU for the San Antonio Spurs. In his five seasons at Kansas, Brown had one Big 8 regular season title, two Big 8 postseason titles, five NCAA Tournament appearances, three Sweet 16 appearances, two trips to the Final Four, and one national title. As a collegiate coach, he had a cumulative coaching record of 177–61 (.744) in seven seasons, including a 135–44 (.754) record at Kansas. His efforts led to him being named ""Coach of the Year"" for the NCAA in 1988 and ""Coach of the Year"" for the Big Eight Conference in 1986. After Brown left Kansas to return to the NBA, NCAA sanctions were levied against Kansas in the 1988–89 season as a result of recruiting violations; potential transfer Vincent Askew was provided with money to leave his campus visit to visit his ill grandmother. No players on any of Brown's teams were named in the report, and Askew did not transfer to Kansas.[11] Brown was hired to coach the San Antonio Spurs in 1988, signing a five-year, $3.5 million contract.[12] With Brown at the helm, the Spurs won the Midwest Division twice. Brown remained with the Spurs until he was fired on January 21, 1992.[13] On February 7, 1992, Brown was hired to coach the Los Angeles Clippers.[14] He took a sub-.500 team in 1992 and guided them to their first winning season since the franchise moved to Los Angeles and their first playoff berth since they were the Buffalo Braves. He followed that up the next season with another playoff appearance in 1993. Brown resigned his position on May 21, 1993.[15] Brown was hired by the Indiana Pacers in June 1993.[16] Under Brown, the Pacers went to two straight conference finals, their first ever. He resigned his position in 1997.[17] Brown was hired as head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers in 1997. Under his leadership, the team reached the 2001 NBA Finals. Brown was named NBA Coach of the Year following the 2000-2001 season. Brown resigned his post in 2003. Brown also served as Director of Basketball Operations in Philadelphia.[18] In 2005, Allen Iverson, who frequently clashed with Brown when he played for him in Philadelphia, said that he was without a doubt ""the best coach in the world.""[19] Brown won his first (and ultimately only) NBA Championship during his first year with the Detroit Pistons in 2004, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers four games to one in the 2004 NBA Finals. By doing so, Brown became the first, and so far only, man to coach teams to both NCAA and NBA titles. Brown is also the only NBA coach to take two teams (76ers and Pistons) to the NBA Finals against the same opponent (Los Angeles Lakers in 2001 and 2004), lose the first time, and win the second. In May 2005, rumors surfaced that Brown would become the Cleveland Cavaliers' team president as soon as the Detroit Pistons finished their postseason. The rumor, which was not dispelled by Brown, became a major distraction as the Pistons lost to the San Antonio Spurs in seven games in the 2005 NBA Finals.[citation needed] On July 19, 2005, the Pistons—displeased with Brown's public flirtations with other teams—bought out the remaining years of Brown's contract, allowing him to sign with another team.[20][21] A week later, on July 28, 2005, Brown became the head coach of the New York Knicks,[22] with a 5-year contract reportedly worth between US$50 million and $60 million, making him the highest-paid coach in NBA history. On January 13, 2006, the Knicks beat the Atlanta Hawks to give Brown his 1,000th win in the NBA, making him only the fourth coach to do so (at the time, the other three were Lenny Wilkens, Don Nelson, and Pat Riley; coincidentally, all three had coached the Knicks at various points).[23] Brown's tenure as Knicks head coach lasted one season. The Knicks fired him on June 23, 2006 after he led the team to a 23–59 record. Brown's season with the Knicks was marred by public feuds with his own players, most notably point guard Stephon Marbury.[24] After the firing, the Knicks declined to pay the remaining sum (more than $40 million) under Brown's contract on the grounds that he had been terminated for cause. Before the contract dispute was to be heard by NBA Commissioner David Stern, Brown reached an agreement with the Knicks wherein the team agreed to pay him $18.5 million.[25] In January 2007, Brown became Executive Vice President of the Philadelphia 76ers.[25] Brown resigned in April 2008.[26] On April 29, 2008, Brown signed to become the head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats – his ninth NBA coaching job.[27] He managed to keep the relatively young team in playoff contention. The following season, Brown guided the Bobcats to the franchise's first-ever playoff appearance. Charlotte was the eighth team he had led to the postseason, an NBA record. On December 22, 2010, Brown parted ways with the Bobcats after the team started the 2010-2011 season with a record of 9–19. His departure was officially characterized as a resignation, but other sources reported that Brown was fired.[28][29] Assistant coach Jeff Capel II told The Charlotte Observer that the entire coaching staff had been fired.[28] On April 17, 2012, ESPN reported that Brown was to be named the new head coach of the SMU Mustangs, replacing Matt Doherty, who had been fired from SMU earlier in March. Tim Jankovich, the head coach of Illinois State, was hired as the coach-in-waiting.[30] After a rebuilding season in 2012–2013 (15-17), Brown brought SMU into the national conversation the following year, leading the team to a 27-10 record in the 2013–2014 season.[citation needed] SMU went on to be the overall number one seed in the National Invitational Tournament, losing in the final game of the tournament to Minnesota.[citation needed] On September 29, 2015, Brown was suspended by the NCAA for 30% of the Mustangs' games in the upcoming 2015–2016 season, and the team was banned from 2016 post-season play, placed on probation for 3 years, and lost 9 scholarships over a 3-year period. The NCAA found that Brown failed to report violations when a former administrative assistant committed academic fraud on behalf of a student-athlete and he initially lied to enforcement staff about his knowledge of the potential violations.[31] On July 8, 2016, Brown announced his resignation as head basketball coach.[32] On June 12, 2018, Brown accepted the proposal of Auxilium Torino to become the new head coach of the Italian basketball club of the Lega Basket Serie A (LBA).[33] On June 17, he officially became new head coach of Torino.[34] He was fired midseason on December 27 with the team's record at just 5–19.[35] Brown was chosen as the head coach for the USA men's basketball team at the 2004 Summer Olympics.[36] That team won the bronze medal at the Olympics; it was the first U.S. men's basketball team to fail to win gold at a Summer Olympics since professional players began playing on the U.S. men's team in 1992.[37] NCAA (2004).

He is the former head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers. Brown began coaching the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2005. The team reached the 2007 NBA Finals, where they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs. Brown was honored as NBA Coach of the Year for leading the Cavaliers to a team-record and league-best 66 wins in 2009. The Cavaliers won 61 games, again a league best, in 2010. However, after the Cavaliers lost to the Boston Celtics in the 2010 Eastern Conference Semifinals, Brown was let go. Brown succeeded Phil Jackson as the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers in 2011 before being fired after the start of the 2012-2013 season. He returned to the Cavaliers in 2013, but was let go after the 2013-2014 season. Brown then joined the Golden State Warriors as associate head coach in 2016; the team went on to defeat the Cavaliers in the 2017 and 2018 NBA Finals. Brown was born in Columbus, Ohio, but spent periods of his childhood overseas. He graduated in 1988 from Würzburg American High School in Würzburg, Germany, where he excelled in basketball and football.[2] After studying and playing basketball for two years at Mesa Community College, Brown went on to the University of San Diego, where he played two seasons for the Toreros and graduated in 1992 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree.[3] In 2000, Brown was hired by Gregg Popovich as an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs.[4] He also was the head coach for the Spurs' summer league teams in Boston and Salt Lake City.[citation needed] The Spurs won an NBA championship in 2003 while Brown was on their coaching staff.[5] In 2003, Brown was hired as associate head coach under Rick Carlisle with the Indiana Pacers.[4] He helped lead Indiana to consecutive playoff appearances, including a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2004.[6] Brown followed Ron Artest into the stands and was instrumental in getting him back to the locker room during the massive brawl between the Pacers, Detroit Pistons, and Pistons fans at the Palace at Auburn Hills on November 19, 2004.[7] Brown remained with the Pacers for two seasons.[5] In June 2005, Brown replaced Brendan Malone as head coach of the head coaching job with the Cleveland Cavaliers. It was his first NBA head coaching position. Brown became the second-youngest coach in the league (trailing only Lawrence Frank).[3] When Brown arrived in Cleveland, the Cavs had missed the playoffs in emerging superstar LeBron James's first two NBA seasons and had not made the playoffs since 1998. Under Brown, they won 50 games, made the 2005-2006 playoffs, and won their first-round series.[8] On June 2, 2007, Brown's Cavaliers defeated the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals and advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history.[9] However, they were swept in four games by his former team, the San Antonio Spurs.[10] On February 1, 2008, Brown was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for January 2008.[11] In 2009, Brown was named coach of the Eastern Conference All-Star team.[12] On April 20, 2009, Brown was named NBA Coach of the Year after guiding the Cavaliers to a league-high[13] and franchise-best 66–16 record.[12] The Cavs won a league-high 61 games in the 2009-2010 season.[14] However, the team was eliminated by the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Semifinals on May 13, 2010. With this loss, the Cavaliers became the first team in NBA history to win 60 games in back-to-back seasons without advancing to the NBA Finals.[15] Brown was fired on May 24, 2010.[16][17] Under Brown's leadership, the Cavs made it past the first round of the NBA playoffs for five consecutive seasons.[18] On May 25, 2011, Brown agreed to succeed Phil Jackson as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. He reportedly agreed to a three-year deal with a team option to renew his contract for a fourth year.[19] On May 31, 2011, he was officially named the Lakers' new head coach.[20] The 2011–12 season was shortened to 66 games by the lockout that season, and the Lakers were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs.[21] Before the 2012–13 season, Brown decided that the Lakers would use a version of the Princeton offense.[22] Shortly afterward, the Lakers acquired All-Stars Steve Nash and Dwight Howard, giving them a starting lineup of five former All-Stars with a combined 33 All-Star game appearances (the other former All-Stars were Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, and Metta World Peace, respectively).[23] Although immediately considered top title contenders, the Lakers struggled to adjust to the changes in both system and personnel, and were winless in eight preseason games.[24] The team's travails continued into the start of the regular season, with the team losing four of its first five games.[25] Nash had played just ​1 1⁄2 games due to injury, Howard was playing but recovering from back surgery, and Bryant had been playing with an injured foot and was unable to practice. On November 9, 2012, Brown was fired.[26] The Lakers felt an urgency to win given their aging stars, Howard's pending free agency, and owner Jerry Buss's deteriorating health.[26][27] Brown's dismissal after five games was the third-fastest coaching change in NBA history.[28] On April 24, 2013, Brown was rehired by the Cavaliers, replacing Byron Scott as head coach.[29] Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert was quoted saying that firing Brown the first time was a ""mistake"".[30] For the first time as a head coach, Brown's team posted a losing record over an 82-game season as his team was marred by injuries and reported infighting in the locker room.[citation needed] On May 12, 2014, he was fired by Gilbert a second time.[31] On July 4, 2016, the Golden State Warriors hired Brown as an assistant coach; he replaced Luke Walton, who departed for a head coaching position with the Los Angeles Lakers.[32] Brown has acted as acting head coach during periods in which head coach Steve Kerr was unable to do so due to chronic back pain. Brown led the Warriors to a 12–0 record in the 2016-2017 NBA playoffs while Kerr was absent;[33] the Warriors went on to win the championship in five games that year, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers.[34] The Warriors finished the playoffs with a 16–1 record, the best postseason winning percentage in NBA history.[35] The Warriors went back to the Finals in 2018 and defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals for the second straight year.[34] On February 5, 2020, he was announced as the new head coach of Nigeria's national basketball team.[36] Media related to Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970) at Wikimedia Commons",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/42.png

Brown was a 6'6"" (1.98 m) and 185 lb (84 kg) small forward and played collegiately at the University of Arkansas. The New Jersey Nets selected Brown in the fourth round of the 1982 NBA Draft as the 82nd overall pick. He played for nine NBA teams in seven seasons and also played in the CBA and overseas with Reggio Emilia in Italy from 1992 to 1994.[1] After his playing career, Brown worked as an advance scout and college talent evaluator for the Milwaukee Bucks from 1994–1997. He has served as an assistant coach for the Portland Trail Blazers (1997 to 2001 under Mike Dunleavy), Detroit Pistons (2001 to 2003 under Rick Carlisle), and Toronto Raptors (2003–2004 under Kevin O'Neill).[2] On May 19, 2004, the Boston Celtics hired Brown to be an assistant under head coach Doc Rivers; The Boston Globe reported that Brown would be a ""defensive coordinator"" in Rivers's staff.[3] Brown substituted for Rivers on March 19, 2006, as Rivers missed the day's game due to a death in the family. The Celtics defeated the Indiana Pacers 103-88. The Celtics led 72-71 after three quarters and opened the fourth with a 9-0 run with a lineup of reserve players Tony Allen, Gerald Green, Kendrick Perkins, Orien Greene, and Al Jefferson.[4] Brown returned to the Bucks at the start of the 2007–08 season to be an assistant this time under Larry Krystkowiak. On November 6, 2007, Brown took the helm as fill-in head coach of the Bucks in a 112–85 win over the Toronto Raptors[5] as Krystkowiak missed the game due to his wife going into labor with twins.[6] The Los Angeles Clippers hired Brown as an assistant in 2009.[7] Brown also filled in for injured Clippers head coach Mike Dunleavy on December 31, 2009, with Los Angeles beating Philadelphia 104–88.[8] On December 7, 2011, Brown replaced Dwane Casey as assistant coach to the Dallas Mavericks.

45,Quinn Buckner,"August 20, 1954",,"Thornridge in Dolton, Illinois",Indiana,1994,1994,1,true,,"""[7]""",/coaches/bucknqu01c.html,"William Quinn Buckner (born August 20, 1954) is an American former professional basketball player and coach. He played collegiate basketball for the Indiana University Hoosiers, and was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 7th pick of the 1976 NBA draft. He had a ten-year NBA career for three teams (the Bucks, the Boston Celtics, and the Indiana Pacers). In 1984, he won an NBA title with the Celtics. Buckner is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA Championship, an NBA Championship, and an Olympic Gold Medal.[1] He also was a State Champion while playing high school basketball in Illinois. In addition to his playing career, Buckner was the head coach of the Dallas Mavericks for one year, from 1993 to 1994. Currently, Buckner is a color analyst for the Indiana Pacers television broadcast team on Fox Sports Indiana. Buckner also was the play-by-play announcer on 989 Sports line of college basketball games for several years. Born in 1954 in Phoenix, Illinois, Buckner played basketball at Thornridge High School in Dolton, Illinois. His Falcons lost only one game during his junior and senior seasons and won back-to-back state titles. The 1972 team was undefeated, with no team coming within 14 points of it, and is often cited as the greatest team in the history of Illinois high school basketball.[2] Buckner was also an excellent football player, making all-state in high school. He is the only person ever named Chicago area Player of the Year for both football and basketball.[3] In 2006, Buckner was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, a group of former players and coaches in honor of the 100 anniversary of the IHSA boys basketball tournament. Buckner elected to play college basketball for the Indiana University Hoosiers under Coach Bob Knight. He ended his college career as a four-year starter and three-year captain at Indiana, and also played football for one year. He seemed to get along with volatile Coach Knight better than any other player in the Hoosiers' history. ""The one thing that I learned early was to respect authority figures, right or wrong"", Buckner told the Dallas Morning News concerning his relationship with Knight. In Buckner's freshman season, 1972–73, Indiana reached the Final Four, losing to UCLA. He played for the United States men's national basketball team in the 1974 FIBA World Championship, winning the bronze medal.[4] In two consecutive seasons, 1974–75 and 1975–76, the Hoosiers were undefeated in the regular season and won 37-consecutive Big Ten games. The 1974–75 Hoosiers swept the entire Big Ten by an average of 22.8 points per game. However, in an 83–82 win against Purdue they lost consensus All-American forward Scott May to a broken left arm. With May's injury keeping him to 7 minutes of play, the No. 1 Hoosiers lost to Kentucky 92–90 in the Mideast Regional. Buckner, along with three of his teammates, would make the five-man All-Big Ten team. The following season, 1975–76, Buckner served as a co-captain and the Hoosiers went the entire season and 1976 NCAA tournament without a single loss, beating Michigan 86–68 in the title game. Indiana remains the last school to accomplish this feat.[5][6] In Buckner's 10-year NBA career he was a tough defender, a solid playmaker, and a stabilizing force in any lineup. At various stages he filled the role of team leader and trusty reserve. Although he scored only 10.0 points per game during his college career, Buckner was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round of the 1976 NBA draft, the seventh pick overall. He was also selected by the Washington Redskins in the 1976 NFL Draft. (Buckner had played free safety on the Hoosiers’ football team for two years.) Before he joined the Bucks, Buckner played on the gold medal–winning 1976 U.S. Olympic basketball team alongside Adrian Dantley, Mitch Kupchak, and Scott May. But nothing could have prepared him for the NBA experience. Buckner's teams had suffered only 25 defeats in his eight years of high school and college basketball, and he had never been on a team that lost more than seven games in a season. But Milwaukee lost 52 times in 1976–77, finishing last in the Midwest Division. Individually, Buckner proved to be a competent NBA player. He was unspectacular offensively, averaging 8.6 points while shooting .434 from the field, but he excelled on defense, ranking fourth in the league with 2.43 steals per game. The next year Buckner raised his scoring slightly, to 9.3 points per game, and was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team. After a similar season in 1978–79, Buckner had his three best years. In 1979–80 he averaged 10.7 points and 5.7 assists, made the NBA All-Defensive Second Team for the second time, and helped the Bucks to the Midwest Division title. Under Coach Don Nelson, Milwaukee had assembled a solid lineup that included forward Marques Johnson, behemoth center Bob Lanier, and guards Brian Winters, Sidney Moncrief, and Junior Bridgeman. The 1980–81 campaign saw Buckner play in all 82 games and notch career highs in scoring (13.3 ppg), field-goal percentage (.493), free-throw percentage (.734), and steals (197, third in the league). He repeated on the NBA All-Defensive Second Team. The Bucks were outstanding, finishing 60–22 with a balanced offense that saw seven players average in double figures. Milwaukee had high hopes for the postseason, but Julius Erving's Philadelphia 76ers derailed the Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Buckner had established a reputation as a solid, dependable player with impeccable fundamentals. He was never going to be a flashy player or a big scorer; in fact, his low-trajectory shot was jokingly said to have been responsible for more bent rims than Darryl Dawkins's dunks. ""My strength is defense,"" he said in the Boston Globe. ""Another is my overall knowledge of the game and being able to get everybody involved in the game. I’ve never had an illusion that shooting is one of my strengths. In fact, it was a very known weakness that I had.…You play with a lot of pride and work hard every night out."" Milwaukee was trying to add a few essential parts that would turn the team into a championship contender, and the bottleneck at guard made Buckner expendable. Before the 1982–83 season he was traded to the Boston Celtics for center Dave Cowens. When Boston signed Buckner, Red Auerbach told the Boston Globe, ""He's a winner, a leader. He rises to the occasion. He has a good personality, he's team oriented, and he's disciplined."" Buckner, who couldn't have said it better himself added, ""I’ve always admired the Boston style of play, and I feel I can play it."" Milwaukee never did win the title. Boston, however, won a championship in 1984, with Buckner coming off the bench to spell Dennis Johnson and Gerald Henderson. The Celtics went 62–20 during the regular season and then nudged the Los Angeles Lakers in a seven-game NBA Finals. With the NBA championship ring, Buckner completed an impressive résumé. In three seasons with Boston, Buckner made small but regular contributions for a powerful Celtics team. The club returned to the Finals in 1985, but the Lakers exacted their revenge, winning in six games. Following the season, Boston traded Buckner to the Indiana Pacers for guard Jerry Sichting. He opened the 1985–86 season with the Pacers but was waived after 32 games, and subsequently retired, ending his 10-year career. He later on became a broadcaster for ESPN and NBC. He also called college and NBA basketball for CBS Sports. With the Indiana Pacers, Buckner is the color commentator for television broadcasts (on Fox Sports Indiana alongside Chris Denari). Buckner participates in community relations efforts and contributes to Pacers TipOff, a game preview newsletter distributed via e-mail for every home Pacers game.[7] He was named head coach of the Dallas Mavericks for 1993–94. The club had gone 11–71 the previous season, and the franchise was in disarray. Although Buckner had no NBA coaching experience, Mavericks owner Donald Carter hoped Buckner's charismatic personality and lifelong knack for winning would rub off on the young team. In an interview with the Arizona Republic, Buckner repeated his success formula: ""Dedication, commitment, extreme concentration, discipline, realizing it can’t be done alone, it has to be done through the team."" Believing that his young charges needed more discipline, Buckner determined from the start to be a stern taskmaster in Knight's mold. The plan backfired, with many of the players (including Jamal Mashburn) complaining publicly about Buckner's heavy-handed coaching style. NBA historian Peter Bjarkman even suggested that Buckner frequently consulted with Knight during the season. They started 1–23, and for a while it looked like they would break the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers record for the most losses in a season. Buckner loosened the reins a little bit as the season wore on, but it was not enough to keep the team from finishing 13–69—by far the worst record in the league, and at the time the worst record ever for a rookie coach who managed to survive for a full season (surpassed by Bill Hanzlik with the 1997-98 Denver Nuggets). Buckner was fired two days after the season ended. In July 2004, Buckner was named the Vice President of Communications for Pacers Sports & Entertainment (PS&E), which owns and operates the Indiana Pacers, the WNBA's Indiana Fever and the Pacers Foundation, Inc. Buckner was appointed to serve a 3-year term on the Indiana University Board of Trustees by then-Indiana governor Mike Pence in June 2016.[8] Buckner has four children with his wife Rhonda; Jason, Cory, Lauren and Alexsandra.

While Wes Wilcox was promoted to general manager, Budenholzer had the final say in all basketball matters.[5] On August 1, 2015, Budenholzer served as Team Africa's assistant coach at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game.[6] On September 19, 2015, Budenholzer was inducted into the Pomona Pitzer Hall of Fame.[7] On April 25, 2018, Budenholzer and the Hawks agreed to part ways,[8] having been removed as president of basketball operations for the Hawks on May 5, 2017.[9] On May 17, 2018, the Milwaukee Bucks announced Budenholzer as their head coach.[10][11] On January 31, 2019, the NBA announced Budenholzer as the head coach of the East All-Star team in 2019.[12][13] On April 13, 2019, Budenholzer was named the 2018–19 Coach of the Year by the National Basketball Coaches Association.[14] Budenholzer is the youngest of seven children born to Vince and Libby Budenholzer.[15] He is of German descent.[16] His father was also a basketball coach and spent 25 years coaching high school and college teams in Arizona before retiring in 1997. Budenholzer has four children: William Vincent, Savoia Elizabeth, Hanna Louise and John Bent.[3] Budenholzer was arrested in Atlanta for suspicion of driving under the influence on August 28, 2013. He was found not guilty of the charge 34 months later by a Fulton County State Court jury on June 27, 2016.[17]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/47.png

50,Jeff Bzdelik,"December 1, 1952",,,University of Illinois at Chicago,2003,2005,3,true,,"""[8]""",/coaches/bzdelje99c.html,"Jeffrey Joseph Bzdelik (/bəzˈdɛlɪk/[1]) (born December 1, 1952) is an American basketball coach who currently is the associate head coach of the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was head coach of the Denver Nuggets in the NBA for slightly over two seasons, from 2002 until he was fired near the end of 2004. He also served as a college head coach at Air Force, Colorado, and Wake Forest. Bzdelik earned four varsity letters while playing basketball at the University of Illinois-Chicago, and was named team MVP in 1975–76. He also spent six years in the Army National Guard.[2] Bzdelik began his coaching career in 1978 as an assistant at Davidson College in North Carolina.[3] He moved to Northwestern University in 1980, where he spent six seasons as an assistant, helping the Wildcats to their first NIT appearance in school history. He then took the head coaching position at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County for two years. Washington Bullets coach Wes Unseld hired Bzdelik as an assistant in 1988. He stayed there until Unseld resigned in 1994. He then took a scouting position with Pat Riley and the New York Knicks before moving with Riley to the Miami Heat the next season as an assistant coach and advance scout. In 1997, Sports Illustrated named Bzdelik the NBA's best advance scout. In 2000, USA Today named him one of the NBA's top five assistants.[4] Bzdelik was hired in 2001 by the Denver Nuggets to be their East Coast scout. He was promoted to assistant coach in July 2002 and impressed team management by going 6–0 in the Rocky Mountain Revue summer league and motivating the team's young players.[3] He was named the head coach of the Nuggets on August 21, 2002.[4] The team struggled in his first year, winning just 17 games. They bounced back in his second season to finish with 43 wins, reaching the postseason for the first time since 1995, before losing in the first round to eventual Western Conference finalist Minnesota. The Nuggets improved their win total by 26 games – the most ever by a team that won less than 20 games the year before and at the time the sixth-best single-season improvement in NBA history.[5] His team also became the first in the history of the NBA to go from less than 20 wins to the playoffs the next year (since going to an 82-game schedule in 1976).[6] The team had high expectations in his third year after signing Kenyon Martin as a free agent. The Nuggets, though, struggled out of the gate to a 13–15 start and Bzdelik was fired on December 28, 2004. On May 18, 2005, Bzedlik signed a multiyear contract to become the head coach at the US Air Force Academy.[7] The team made a first round NCAA tournament appearance – just the fourth in school history – his first year after finishing with the best record (24–7) in the program's 50-year history.[8] The Falcons have not appeared in the NCAA tournament since. The next year, they surpassed the record from the previous year by winning 26 games and made it to the NIT semifinals. Bzdelik left Air Force on April 4, 2007, to become the head basketball coach for the Colorado Buffaloes for three seasons.[8][9] In his third and final season at CU, Bzdelik's team finished the regular season with four wins in its last six games. A first-round loss to Texas Tech in the Big 12 Tournament ended the Buff's season and left the team with a 15–16 record, their third straight losing season under Bzdelik. On April 13, 2010, Bzdelik left Colorado to become the 21st head men's basketball coach at Wake Forest University, inheriting a successful team that was 21–12 the previous season, and had made back to back NCAA Tournament appearances.[9] He resigned from Wake Forest in March 2014.[10] His records at Wake Forest were 8–24 (2010–11), 13–18 (2011–12), 13–18 (2012–13) and 17–16 (in his final season in 2013–14).[11] On July 31, 2014, Bzdelik was signed by the Memphis Grizzlies to be an assistant coach.[12] The Grizzlies completed the regular season 55–27, tied for the fifth-best record in the entire NBA. During his 19 years in the NBA, Bzdelik served as a head or assistant coach for 12 teams that advanced to the playoffs.[13][14][15][16][17] On June 1, 2016, Bzdelik became associate head coach of the Houston Rockets,[18] joining the staff of newly appointed head coach Mike D'Antoni. ""It stood out to us that he had so much head coaching experience,"" Rockets general manager Daryl Morey said. ""That level of experience and gravitas really helps when you are explaining the battle plan. Second, the coaching tree he comes from is second to none. And there was a lot of respect from being the primary guy with the Memphis defense.""[19] One of the least-discussed plots was the fact that head coach Mike D'Antoni willingly accepted a ""defensive coordinator"" with the addition of Jeff Bzdelik. D'Antoni brought the glitz, the glamor and the stats to Houston, while Bzdelik has helped keep the team from having a one-track mind. ""Players hear one voice offensively and one voice defensively,"" D'Antoni said recently when talking about Bzdelik's role on the NBA A-Z podcast.[20] Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle wrote, ""It adds up to (Bzdelik's) place on D'Antoni's right, with respect and freedom to more than run the defense, but to change the mindset of the team happy to fire away but that has come to understand it must do more."" ""We discuss everything, how we want to do things, how we want to present it,"" D'Antoni said. ""He has a great connection with players. He has to be the little pest to get them to pay attention to detail. He's great at it. It works for me because I trust him completely. It allows me to concentrate on relationships, the offensive side, dealing with (media). I knew he was thorough. He's perfect.""[19] In 2016–17, the Rockets were the best team in the NBA at defending the handler in ball screens. They ranked second in charges drawn, second in defending the screener/roller in ball screens, third in forcing a second action in ball screens and third in defensive 3-point field goal percentage.[21] According to the Houston Chronicle, ""the Rockets improved in the ways they needed to most, in defending the arc and in transition. But Bzdelik knows that changing mindsets takes more time."" ""The first thing we talked about when we got together in the summer was 'If you don't defend, you're not going to win,' "" Bzdelik said. ""History shows that. It's that simple. You're not going to run around scoring a lot of points, getting open shots in the playoffs. You better guard. And you can't just turn it on and turn it off."" ""All year long, we've worked on our habits for this moment. There needs to be an understanding that it takes all five players on the court to get stops. Through the whole course of the year, we've been on players to understand we need to have the right habits. When you talk about championship cultures, teammates don't just play with each other, they play for each other. They refuse to let each other down. That's the culture we're trying to create defensively.""[19] In 2017-18, the Rockets won a franchise record 65 games, posting the NBA's best record for the first time. Bzdelik coached under D'Antoni in the 2018 NBA All-Star Game in Los Angeles.[22] The Rockets lost the Conference Finals to the eventual NBA champion Golden State Warriors in seven games. Star guard Chris Paul missed Games 6 and 7 of that series with a hamstring injury.[23] Defensively, the Rockets were ""inconsistent in the first half of the season, but had the third-rated defense in the NBA since Harden and Luc Mbah a Moute returned from injuries in mid-January at roughly the mid-point of the season.""[24] During the season, Bzdelik was profiled by VICE Sports. ""In over a dozen interviews with coaches, players, and basketball executives who have worked with Bzdelik, the portrait of a hyper-driven, beloved, and tactically adept coach who has stockpiled inestimable reams of information over the course of an astounding career emerges."" Hall of Fame coach and executive Pat Riley, who worked with Bzdelik in both New York and Miami, said, ""I can't think of a man in the NBA that has more experience, more knowledge, more wisdom about how to defend in the contemporary game today, than Jeff. I was just always impressed with his scouting reports. He was very detailed. Very neat. Things were logical and coherent. He had all the right calls. We knew what the other team was gonna run.""[25] On September 17, 2018, Bzdelik announced his retirement from coaching in the NBA.[26] On November 5, 2018, Bzdelik agreed to return to the Rockets. At the time, Houston was ranked 21st in the league on defense after being sixth the year before.[27] On May 18, 2019, Bzdelik was let go by the Rockets during the off-season.[28] Prior to this, he had publicly been noncommittal to returning in following seasons.[29][30] On July 8, 2019, Jeff Bzdelik accepted a Defensive Coaching position with the New Orleans Pelicans [31]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/50.png
51,John Calipari,"February 10, 1959",,,Clarion University of Pennsylvania,1997,1999,3,true,,"""[3]""",/coaches/calipjo99c.html,"John Vincent Calipari (born February 10, 1959) is an American basketball coach. Since 2009, he has been the head coach of the University of Kentucky men's team, with whom he won the NCAA Championship in 2012. He has been named Naismith College Coach of the Year three times (in 1996, 2008 and 2015), and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2015. He was previously the head coach at the University of Massachusetts from 1988 to 1996, the NBA's New Jersey Nets from 1996 to 1999 and the University of Memphis from 2000 to 2009, and was the head coach of the Dominican Republic national team in 2011 and 2012. Calipari has coached Kentucky to four Final Fours, in 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015. He also led UMass and Memphis to the Final Four in 1996 and 2008 respectively; those appearances were later vacated, though Calipari was not personally responsible - and was fully cleared of any and all wrongdoing - in both cases.[2] As a college coach, Calipari has twenty-six 20-win seasons, eleven 30-win seasons, and five 35-win seasons. As of February 15th 2020, with 728 official wins, Calipari ranks 25th on the NCAA Division 1 all-time winningest coaches list. Calipari was born in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is of Italian descent. He attended Moon Area High School and graduated in 1978. Calipari was a high school point guard who was a fringe division one prospect. Calipari lettered two years at UNC Wilmington before transferring to Clarion University of Pennsylvania, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in marketing. He played point guard at Clarion during the 1981 and 1982 seasons, leading the team in assists and free throw percentage. From 1982 to 1985, Calipari was an assistant at the University of Kansas under Ted Owens and Larry Brown.[3][4] Calipari had several jobs as the lowest coach in the pecking order when Ted Owens hired him as a volunteer assistant for the Jayhawks' 1982–83 season, including serving food at the training table.[3] ""I was blessed to have the chance. Can you imagine being 22, 23 and your first opportunity to be around the game is at a program like Kansas?""[3] From 1985 to 1988, he was an assistant coach at the University of Pittsburgh under Roy Chipman and Paul Evans. From 1988 to 1996, he was head coach at the University of Massachusetts. From 1996 to 1999, he was head coach and Executive VP of basketball operations for the NBA's New Jersey Nets. During the 1999–2000 season, he was an assistant coach for the Philadelphia 76ers under coach Larry Brown, before moving on to his next position at the University of Memphis. Calipari is famous for popularizing the dribble drive motion offense, developed by Vance Walberg, which is sometimes known as the ""Memphis Attack"". In his 22 official seasons (23 seasons overall) as a collegiate head coach, Calipari's record is 667–194 (.775). His record in the month of March is 107–37 (.743). His NCAA adjusted (the records of two appearances being removed) official record in the NCAA tournament is 38–12 (.760), and in the NIT is 15–6 (.714). His teams have made 15 NCAA tournament appearances (13 official, due to 2 later being vacated), including reaching the Sweet Sixteen 12 times (10 official, due to 2 later being vacated), the Elite Eight 10 times (8 official, due to 2 later being vacated), the Final Four 6 times (4 official, due to 2 later being vacated), the NCAA Championship Game 3 times (twice officially, with the 2008 Championship Game appearance while at Memphis being vacated by the NCAA), winning the NCAA Championship at Kentucky in 2012, and finishing NCAA Runner Up in 2014. As a college coach, Calipari has 21 20-win seasons (20 official) and 9 30-win seasons (8 official). He has also coached 6 teams to the NIT, winning the NIT Championship at Memphis in 2002. He is one of only four coaches in NCAA Division I history to direct three different schools to a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.[5] The “Platoon System”, established under John Calipari not only provided life for the University of Kentucky's basketball team, but it also provided an important defensive weapon. The Platoon System was introduced in 2014, and consisted of playing 10 men in legions of five. Each platoon includes 3 ball handlers and 2 taller players. What makes the Platoon System so special is that most teams cannot play two seven foot players on the court at all time. Since 2009, the Wildcats head coach John Calipari has been on the top of the high school basketball recruiting mountain. Recruiting has always been paramount for John Calipari and the Kentucky Wildcats. According to the Washington Post, Calipari's teams have been a defensive powerhouse, historically ranking in the top 50 in Ken Pomeroy's defensive debate. Because of his successful recruiting John Calipari is able to bring in elite talent, and does not have to use a mundane 2-3 zone, or man to man defensive tactics to gain a defensive edge. Due to the use of four seven foot front court players,[6] Kentucky has had the ability to display their defensive shot blocking presence. One notable statistic is that, from 2002 to 2018, all 25 players coached by Calipari who chose to enter the NBA draft after their first season were drafted in the first round. This streak started with Dajuan Wagner at the University of Memphis, and ended when Kentucky Wildcat Jarred Vanderbilt was not drafted until the second round.[7] From 1988 to 1996 at UMass, Calipari led the Minutemen program to five consecutive Atlantic 10 titles and NCAA Tournament appearances, including periods where the program was ranked first nationally. He finished with a 193–71 record overall, with a 91–41 record in Atlantic 10 conference games. Calipari was named Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year in 1992, 1993, and 1996. He was also named the Naismith, NABC, Basketball Times & Sporting News National Coach of the Year in 1996. He led UMass to its first-ever appearance in the Final Four with the play of the John R. Wooden Award winner and Naismith College Player of the Year Marcus Camby, although this appearance was later vacated by the NCAA because Camby had accepted about $28,000 worth of gifts, in particular a gold chain, from two sports agents who were luring him to enter the NBA draft after his Sophomore season.[8] Calipari helped accelerate the construction of the Mullins Center, UMass' basketball and hockey facility. He also reached out to eastern Massachusetts and Boston to enlarge the fan base. Before moving on to the New Jersey Nets, Calipari became the second winningest coach in UMass history behind Jack Leaman.[9] In 2010, ESPN.com writer Pat Forde, in his ""Forde Minutes"" column, said of the 1992 team: In the Sweet 16 matchup with Kentucky in 1992, official Lenny Wirtz issued Calipari a controversial technical foul for being outside the coach's box during a crucial UMass possession. Kentucky went on to face Duke in the next round in one of the greatest games in college basketball history, won on a last-second shot by Christian Laettner. In 1993, UMass defeated defending NCAA champion and preseason #1 North Carolina in the pre-season NIT in Madison Square Garden. The following year #3 UMass defeated defending NCAA champion and #1 Arkansas in the Hall of Fame Tip-Off classic, which resulted in UMass becoming the first New England college basketball team to be voted #1 in the Associated Press poll. During Calipari's tenure at UMass, the program became one of the most dominant in college basketball despite recruiting just one McDonald's All-American (Donta Bright) and having only two players drafted by an NBA team (Lou Roe and Marcus Camby). Forde recalled the Final Four team in Calipari's final UMass season in 1995–96 as a squad ""with one superstar (Marcus Camby) and a collection of complementary parts"".[10] By winning both the Atlantic 10 regular season and conference tournament championships from 1992 to 1996, UMass became the second team in college basketball history to win 5 consecutive regular season and conference tournament championships (NC State was the first.) In the 1996–97 season, John Calipari replaced Butch Beard as head coach of the New Jersey Nets. After a 26–56 debut season, the Nets made a major draft-day trade in June 1997, acquiring Keith Van Horn, Lucious Harris and two other players in exchange for Tim Thomas. In 1997, while coaching the New Jersey Nets, Calipari directed profanities at Star-Ledger sports reporter Dan Garcia and referred to him as a ""Mexican idiot"".[11] Garcia sued for $5,000,000 for emotional distress. Though the case was dismissed[12] and Calipari apologized for his remarks,[11] he was still fined $25,000 by the NBA.[13] The 1997–98 season was a lone bright spot for the Nets in the late 1990s. The team played well under Calipari, winning 43 games and qualifying for the playoffs on the last day of the season. The Nets were seeded eighth in the Eastern Conference and lost to the Chicago Bulls in the 1998 playoffs in three straight games. The 1998–99 season was delayed for three months due to an owners' lockout of the players. When the abbreviated 50-game season began, the Nets were a choice by experts as a surprise team. However, Sam Cassell was injured in the first game and the team started poorly. With the Nets underachieving at 3–15, the Nets traded Cassell to the Milwaukee Bucks, while the Nets acquired Stephon Marbury from the Minnesota Timberwolves. After two more losses, Calipari was fired as head coach with the team at 3–17. He finished his tenure with an overall record of 72 wins and 112 losses, and a .391 overall winning percentage. He then joined Larry Brown as an assistant coach for the Philadelphia 76ers.[14] Calipari became head coach at the University of Memphis in 2000. In Calipari's first nine years as head coach at Memphis, he won 214 games (38 wins were vacated) and posted seven consecutive 20-win seasons, plus one more in his final season (including an NCAA record four consecutive 30-win seasons, though the third season was vacated and this record no longer holds). He also earned seven consecutive postseason bids (plus one in his final season). His 2007–2008 team's 38 victories set a new NCAA Division I Men's Basketball record for most victories in a season, a record that now belongs to the 2011–2012 Kentucky Wildcats due to NCAA violations that vacated all of Memphis' wins. The nine consecutive 20-win seasons and the nine consecutive postseason appearances would have been the most in school history, though that officially stands now at seven because of the vacated 2007–08 season. He was named Conference USA Coach of the Year in 2006, 2008, and 2009. In 2008, he was named Naismith College Coach of the Year, receiving the honor for the second time.[15] In 2009, he was named Sports Illustrated College Basketball Coach of the Year.[16] He built a national program by recruiting blue chip players from the Eastern part of the country, such as Dajuan Wagner from Camden (NJ), Darius Washington Jr. from Orlando (FL), Rodney Carney from Indianapolis (IN), Shawne Williams from Memphis (TN), Joey Dorsey from Baltimore (MD), Chris Douglas-Roberts from Detroit (MI), Antonio Anderson from Lynn (MA), Robert Dozier from Lithonia (GA), Derrick Rose from Chicago (IL), and Tyreke Evans from Aston (PA). While at Memphis, Calipari popularized the dribble drive motion offense that was invented by former Pepperdine basketball coach Vance Walberg.[17][18] On January 21, 2008, Calipari led the Tigers to the No. 1 ranking in the AP Poll for only the second time in school history. In 2006 and 2008, Memphis earned a No. 1 seed in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. In 2008, Calipari's Tigers advanced to the national championship game, their first under his leadership. They also won 38 games, the most regular-season wins in NCAA history (his 2011–12 Kentucky team would also go on to win 38 games). His team, however, would lose to the Kansas Jayhawks, 75–68, in overtime. This team later had its entire season record vacated by the NCAA because ETS invalidated Derrick Rose's SAT. Despite this, Rose still denies any wrongdoing. The NCAA began to investigate the test and contacted the ETS. Because the NCAA had begun to investigate, ETS decided to review the test. The ETS sent three letters to Rose's family's former address in Chicago (instead of his dorm in Memphis) to ask that Rose verify some information on his test. Because he did not reply to the letters, ETS invalidated his SAT. This happened even though the NCAA investigated and reported that they could not find significant evidence to prove that Rose did not take the test. Because the ETS had invalidated the test, the NCAA retroactively declared Rose ineligible. To this day, the official position of the NCAA is that Rose did take his own SAT. If not for the vacated wins, Calipari would be the winningest coach in Tigers history, as he would have 252 wins to Larry Finch's 220. On May 28, 2010, John Calipari, Derrick Rose, and University of Memphis athletic director R.C. Johnson reached a $100,000 out-of-court settlement with three attorneys who represented Memphis season ticket holders and threatened a lawsuit over the vacated 2007–08 season. Also as part of the settlement, Calipari donated his near-$232,000 bonus to the Memphis scholarship fund.[19] On March 30, 2009, four days after Memphis' season ending loss to Missouri in the NCAA Tournament, multiple sources reported that Calipari would agree to be the head coach at the University of Kentucky, after UK's head coach, Billy Gillispie, was fired after two unsuccessful seasons at the school.[20] Calipari rejected a counter offer by Memphis for Kentucky's 8 year, $31.65 million contract.[21] According to university officials, John Calipari signed a written contract on March 31, 2009. The contract was worth $34.65 million over 8 years, plus incentives.[21] On April 1, 2009, the University of Kentucky Director of Athletics, Mitch Barnhart, formally introduced John Calipari as the new coach of the University of Kentucky Wildcats. During the press conference, Calipari spoke at length about his relationships with former UK basketball players and coaches, and also in his difficulties in accepting the UK job, largely due to his deep emotional ties with both the city of Memphis and University of Memphis. Calipari stated, ""Coming to UK was the easy part, it was leaving the city of Memphis that was the hard part."" He went on to refer to the University of Kentucky coaching position as his ""dream job"". Calipari became the 22nd coach overall at Kentucky, and just the 7th coach in the last 79 years for the Wildcats. In his first year as head coach, Calipari had a highly touted recruiting class, including the No. 1 overall rated recruit, John Wall, plus fellow 5-star recruits, DeMarcus Cousins, Eric Bledsoe, and Daniel Orton. On December 21, 2009, Calipari led the Cats to their 12th victory of the season and the program's 2,000th victory ever. Kentucky won its 44th SEC Regular Season Championship in 2009–10, with a 14–2 conference record. Calipari's team followed this up with the UK's 26th SEC Tournament Championship, with an overtime defeat of Mississippi State, 75–74, in the SEC Tournament title game. In the NCAA Tournament, however, No. 1 seed Kentucky (East Region) was upset by West Virginia in the Elite 8, to finish the season at 35–3. In his second season at Kentucky, Calipari recruited the No. 1 rated point guard in the 2010 class, Brandon Knight. In addition to Knight, Calipari also signed two other 5-star recruits, Terrence Jones and Doron Lamb. In 2010–11, Kentucky finished the regular season with a record of 22–8, with a 10–6 record in SEC regular season play. UK would go on to win its second consecutive SEC Tournament Championship, defeating Florida, 70–54, in the SEC Tournament title game. As a result, Kentucky received a No. 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament (East Regional). During the NCAA Tournament, Kentucky would go on to defeat No. 1 overall seed Ohio State, 62–60, in the Sweet-16. In the Elite Eight, Calipari's team would avenge an early season loss to North Carolina, by defeating the Tar Heels, 76–69, securing Kentucky's first Final Four appearance since 1998. In the Final Four, UK fell to the eventual NCAA Champions, UConn, by one point, 56–55, finishing with a final record of 29–9. In this third season, Kentucky landed another No. 1 recruiting class with four consensus five star players: Anthony Davis, Marquis Teague, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Kyle Wiltjer. Kentucky came into the season ranked #2 in the country. They finished the regular season with a 30–1 record, their only loss to Indiana by a buzzer-beater and went 16–0 in conference play. In the SEC tournament, Kentucky lost in the championship game to Vanderbilt 71–64. In the NCAA Tournament, Calipari's team was selected as the overall #1 seed in the tournament, representing as the South Region #1 seed. Kentucky avenged the early season loss to Indiana beating them in the Sweet Sixteen 102–90, and knocked off Baylor in the Elite Eight 82–70, to advance to their second consecutive Final Four. In the Final Four in New Orleans, Kentucky first faced their in-state rival, the Louisville Cardinals and Rick Pitino, winning 69–61. Two days later, in the National Championship game, Kentucky played in another early season rematch against the Kansas Jayhawks, winning a hard-fought contest 67–59. The win secured Calipari his first NCAA Championship, a NCAA record 38-win season, and the 8th overall NCAA Championship for Kentucky. By doing so, John Calipari became the 5th head coach to win a NCAA Championship at Kentucky (a NCAA record), and the first coach to do so at the school since Tubby Smith in 1998. Following the 2012 championship, UK Athletics Director Mitch Barnhart announced on May 4 that Calipari's contract had been renegotiated. Under the new contract, Calipari will make up to $8.0 million annually [23] (not including bonuses), which further cements his status as one of the most highly compensated college basketball coaches in the country. Mike Krzyzewski, coach of the Duke University team, leads the NCAA at an annual salary of $9.8 million.[citation needed] In April 2019, Calipari agreed to a ""lifetime"" contract with Kentucky, centered on a 10-year coaching extension, and a lifetime paid ambassadorship when he retires.[24] * ^a b c UMass had its 4–1 record in the 1996 NCAA tournament and Final Four standing vacated after Marcus Camby was ruled ineligible due to his contact with a sports agent. ** ^a b c d e f The NCAA vacated 38 wins and 1 loss from Memphis's 2007–08 season under Calipari due to violations of NCAA rules.[25] *** ^ Under current NCAA official records, Calipari's record as of February 15th, 2020 is 728–214 (.773), which accounts for the 4 vacated wins (and one vacated loss) in the 1995–96 NCAA Tournament at UMass, and the 38 vacated wins (and 1 vacated losses) at Memphis in the entire 2007–08 season.[26] Calipari's actual on-the-court record is 770–215 (.782) On February 26, 2011, after Kentucky beat the Florida Gators in Rupp Arena, Calipari was recognized for his 500th career victory as a Division I men's basketball coach. Over the course of the next few months, the NCAA's Committee on Infractions (COI) and the University of Kentucky exchanged letters debating whether Calipari had indeed reached the 500-win milestone. Due to games vacated by the NCAA in two different seasons (the 1996 season at UMass and the 2008 season at Memphis), the NCAA only officially recognized Calipari's 500th all time coaching victory on March 15, 2012.[citation needed] Calipari was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. On September 11, 2015 he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. As of the 2015–2016 NCAA Division I college basketball season, John Calipari is one of only 6 active coaches enshrined. He has written several books, including Bounce Back: Overcoming Setbacks to Succeed in Business and in Life (2009)[27] and Players First: Coaching from the Inside Out (2014).[28] Additionally, Calipari starred in the 30 for 30 documentary from ESPN ""One and Not Done"" which details his professional career. Calipari, who has dual citizenship with the U.S. and Italy,[29] has been married to his wife Ellen since 1986. They have two daughters, Erin, a neuropharmacologist who played basketball at UMass,[29] and Megan, a French pastry chef, and a son, Brad, who played basketball at Kentucky for two seasons.[30][31] Brad graduated from Kentucky in May 2019 with two remaining seasons of college eligibility, and chose to transfer to the University of Detroit Mercy to complete his college playing career.[32] On February 13, 1994, Temple University basketball coach John Chaney threatened to kill Calipari at a post-game news conference, while Calipari was speaking at a podium. Chaney entered the conference mid-speech, called him an ""Italian son of a bitch,"" accusing Calipari of manipulating the referees. When Calipari attempted to respond to the accusations, Chaney yelled, ""Shut up goddammit!"", and proceeded to charge the stage, before being stopped by security. While being held back, Chaney shouted, ""When I see you, I'm gonna kick your ass!"" As security restrained Chaney, he repeatedly yelled, ""I'll kill you!"" and angrily admitted telling his players to ""knock your fucking kids in the mouth."" Chaney received a one-game suspension for the incident.[33][34] Cheney apologized a few days later and they eventually reconciled.[35]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/51.png

The victory also ended UCLA's 51 victories in Pauley Pavilion.[1] He played seven seasons (1969–1976) in the now-defunct American Basketball Association (ABA) and four seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Calvin began his professional career with the ABA's Los Angeles Stars, averaging 16.8 points per game in his first season to make the ABA All-Rookie Team. The following season, he averaged a career-high 27.2 points for The Floridians, in the process setting the ABA records for most free throws made (696) and most free throws attempted (805) in one season.[2] Calvin also played for the ABA's Carolina Cougars, Denver Nuggets, and Virginia Squires before the ABA–NBA merger in 1976.

He is also a television broadcaster, having worked with ESPN, The NBA on TNT, Westwood One, Fox Sports Southwest, Pac-12 Network, The NBA on NBC and CSN New England. Carlesimo served as head coach of four different NBA teams, and was named Seton Hall University's ""Coach of the Century."" He was an assistant coach for the United States men's Olympic basketball team (""The Dream Team"") that won the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics. He was also an assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs team that won three championships between 2003 and 2007. Carlesimo is married and has two sons. He is the son of college basketball coach and athletic director Peter A. Carlesimo.[1] Carlesimo is a 1971 graduate of Fordham University, where he played basketball under coach Digger Phelps. He began his coaching career as an assistant at the school after he graduated. He received his first head coaching job when he took over New Hampshire College (now Southern New Hampshire University) for one year, beginning in 1975. The New Hampshire Penmen ended the 1975–1976 season with a 14–13 record and won the Mayflower Conference championship.[2] Carlesimo also had a successful coaching stint at Wagner College of Staten Island, New York, a Division I school, leading the team to two NIT berths in six years as coach from 1976 to 1982.[3] In addition, Carlesimo spent time coaching in Puerto Rico during the summers.[4] Carlesimo coached Seton Hall University from 1982–1994, leading the turnaround of a struggling program. The Pirates made their first ever NCAA tournament in 1988, and Carlesimo was named the Big East Conference coach of the year. In 1989, Carlesimo led the Pirates to their first-ever Final Four appearance following a 78–65 upset over the #2 seed Indiana Hoosiers coached by Bobby Knight.[5] They advanced to the NCAA Championship game against the Michigan Wolverines, but lost in overtime 80–79.[6] Carlesimo was again named Big East coach of the year, following the 1989 season. During Carlesimo's tenure, the Pirates made the NCAA tournament six times, four consecutively from 1991 until 1994. After going 6–23 his first season, he turned the team into a consistent title contender and eventual tournament runner-up and number one seed. Compiling an overall record of 212–166, he was named Seton Hall's ""Coach of the Century.""[7] Carlesimo was an assistant coach under Mike Krzyzewski with the U.S. national team in the 1990 FIBA World Championship, winning the bronze medal.[8] He also served as an assistant coach on the 1992 Olympic ""Dream Team"", winning the gold medal. On June 23, 1994, Carlesimo was hired as head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.[9] Midway into his first season with the team, the team traded long-time Blazer Clyde Drexler in an effort to rebuild. However instead of falling in the standings, Carlesimo led the team to a winning record and the playoffs in his first season as an NBA head coach. He led the Blazers to the playoffs in each of his three years as their head coach, but was unable to lead the team out of the first round of the playoffs and was fired following the 1996–97 season. In 1997, Carlesimo headed to the Golden State Warriors, again succeeding Rick Adelman as head coach (Adelman had previously coached the Trail Blazers prior to Carlesimo's hiring). He coached that team until December 1999, at which point he was fired after his team got off to a losing start for the third straight year. In a practice during the 1997–98 season while Carlesimo was head coach of the Warriors, Carlesimo was attacked by Latrell Sprewell.[10][11] Sprewell choked Carlesimo for nearly 15 seconds until being pulled off by several teammates, and elbowed him several minutes later. The Warriors terminated Sprewell's contract, and the NBA suspended him for one year (later reduced to 68 games by an arbitrator); he never played for the Warriors again and continued to have troubles on and off the court. After leaving the Warriors, Carlesimo worked as a broadcaster and analyst with The NBA on TNT until being hired as an assistant coach under Gregg Popovich in 2002. He worked with the Spurs until 2007, winning three championships in five seasons (2003, 2005 and 2007). Spurs GM Sam Presti was hired as general manager of the Seattle SuperSonics following the 2007 championship, and hired Carlesimo as their head coach on July 5, 2007.[12] The team broke up their core of Ray Allen, Rashard Lewis, Delonte West and Wally Sczerbiak, essentially guaranteeing Carlesimo limited success for his first season.[13] That season, their second overall pick Kevin Durant was named NBA Rookie of the Year. The Sonics relocated to Oklahoma City a year later, where they become the Oklahoma City Thunder, making him the first coach in Thunder history. Carlesimo was fired on November 22, 2008 by the Thunder after a 1–12 start.[14] During his time with the Sonics and Thunder, he coached the USA select basketball team that scrimmaged the national team in preparation of the 2007 FIBA tournament and 2008 Summer Olympics.[15] The team included Kevin Durant and Jeff Green of the Thunder. On May 31, 2010, Carlesimo had reached an agreement to join the Toronto Raptors as an assistant coach under Jay Triano.[16] After one season with the Raptors, he was hired as an assistant coach by the New Jersey Nets[17] (later known as the Brooklyn Nets). On December 27, 2012, he was promoted to interim head coach of the Nets after the firing of Avery Johnson.[18] Carlesimo took a team floundering at 14–14, and compiled 35–19 record for a fourth-place finish in the East, earning home-court advantage for the Nets in the first round. On May 5, 2013, Nets GM Billy King announced Carlesimo would not be retained as head coach after the team lost in their first round series against the Chicago Bulls in 7 games.[19]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/54.png

He has also served as head coach of the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons.[1][2][3][4] As a player, Carlisle played for the Boston Celtics, New York Knicks and New Jersey Nets. He is also one of only 11 people to win an NBA championship both as a player and as a coach.[5] Carlisle was raised in Lisbon, New York. He attended Lisbon Central High School, then spent a year at Worcester Academy. He played two years of college basketball at the University of Maine from 1979 to 1981, before transferring to the University of Virginia.[6] Carlisle was a starter for the 1982–83 Virginia Cavaliers team that featured the three-time college player of the year Ralph Sampson. UVA was the number one ranked team in the country prior to being defeated by Chaminade on December 23, 1982. In the 1983 NCAA tournament, UVA was the number one seed in the West and made it to the Elite Eight before losing to eventual NCAA national champion North Carolina State. Carlisle was the co-captain on the 1983–84 Cavaliers team and helped lead them to the Final Four where they lost 49–47 in overtime to the Houston Cougars team led by Akeem Olajuwon. Carlisle averaged 12.5 points and 3.3 rebounds per game during his college career. After graduating in 1984 Carlisle was selected 70th overall by the Boston Celtics in the 1984 NBA draft, where he played alongside Larry Bird. Under Celtics' coach K. C. Jones he won the NBA championship in 1986 and lost in the finals in 1985 and 1987. In a limited reserve role from 1984 to 1987 Carlisle averaged 2.2 points, 1.0 assists and 0.8 rebounds per game. He then played for the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) under Bill Musselman, being signed as a free agent by the New York Knicks, where he played under coach Rick Pitino alongside emerging star Patrick Ewing. In 1989, Carlisle played in five games with the New Jersey Nets under Bill Fitch. Later in 1989, he accepted an assistant coaching position with the Nets, where he spent five seasons under Bill Fitch and Chuck Daly. In 1994, Carlisle joined the assistant coaching staff with the Portland Trail Blazers under coach P. J. Carlesimo, where he spent three seasons. In 1997, Carlisle joined the Indiana Pacers organization as an assistant coach under former teammate, Larry Bird. During his time as Pacers assistant coach, he helped the Pacers to two of their best seasons ever. First, in 1997–98, the Pacers stretched the Chicago Bulls to the limit, narrowly losing the deciding seventh game of the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual NBA champion. Then, in 1999–2000 season, the Pacers made the NBA Finals for the first time, ultimately losing to the Los Angeles Lakers.[7] Bird stepped down as coach, and pushed for Carlisle to be selected as his replacement, but Pacers team president Donnie Walsh gave the job to Isiah Thomas.[8] For the 2001–02 season, Carlisle was hired by the Detroit Pistons to be their new head coach. In two seasons as Pistons' head coach, Carlisle led the team to consecutive 50–32 records (.610) with Central Division titles and playoff appearances. He was named Coach of the Year in 2002. However, the Pistons fired Carlisle after the 2002–03 season with a year remaining on his contract and hired Larry Brown. Friction between Carlisle and team ownership was cited as one of the primary reasons for the firing. Carlisle's Pistons had just dispatched Brown's Philadelphia 76ers in the Conference Semifinals before being swept by the New Jersey Nets in the Eastern Conference Finals. For the 2003–04 season, Carlisle was re-hired by the Indiana Pacers, this time as its head coach (Isiah Thomas had been fired,[9] almost immediately after Larry Bird was brought back as the new President of Basketball Operations). In his first season, Carlisle led the Pacers to the Central Division title and NBA's best regular-season record at 61–21 (74.4%), setting a franchise record for wins. In the playoffs, the team eliminated both the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat, before losing to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. That year, he coached the East All-Stars at the All-Star Game.[10] In 2005, the Pacers roster was decimated by injuries (most notably, those of Jermaine O'Neal, Stephen Jackson and Jamaal Tinsley) and suspensions that were meted out after the Pacers–Pistons brawl at The Palace of Auburn Hills, which resulted in Ron Artest being suspended for the rest of the season, Jackson being suspended for 30 games and O'Neal being suspended for 15 games. However, Carlisle was still able to rally the Pacers to the NBA Playoffs that season. As the sixth seed, they again defeated the Boston Celtics in the first round, before being defeated once again by the eventual Eastern Conference champion, the Detroit Pistons. After the Pacers finished the 2006–07 season with a 35–47 record (missing the playoffs for the first time since 1997), Carlisle's tenure as head coach ended;[11] it was unclear whether he voluntarily resigned, was fired, or was pushed to resign. In four seasons with the Indiana Pacers, Carlisle compiled a 181–147 record.[12] On June 12, 2007, Carlisle announced that he would also resign from his position as Executive Vice President of the Indiana Pacers. After leaving Indiana, Carlisle worked as a studio analyst for ESPN[13] before signing with the Dallas Mavericks as the team's new head coach. On May 9, 2008, Carlisle signed a four-year deal with Mark Cuban's Dallas Mavericks, replacing Avery Johnson.[14] He led them to a 50–32 record including a first round win against the San Antonio Spurs. They would lose to the Denver Nuggets 4–1 in the Western Conference Semifinals.[4][15] The next year, he coached the Mavs to a 55–27 record, first in Southwest Division and second in the West, but lost in the first round to the Spurs. In 2010, Dallas won sixteen of its first twenty games in a competitive Western Conference. The 2010–11 season was Carlisle's most successful as a head coach. The Mavericks finished the regular season with a 57–25 win-loss record. On May 8, 2011, they swept the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semifinals. On May 25, 2011, the Mavericks enjoyed a 4–1 series win over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals, the first Conference Finals victory of his coaching career. In the 2011 NBA Finals, he coached the Mavericks to a 4–2 series victory over the Miami Heat for the franchise's first championship.[16] In the 2012 playoffs, the Mavericks lost 0–4 to Thunder in the first round. On May 15, 2012, Carlisle agreed to a new four-year deal with the Mavericks. In 2013, the Mavericks finished 41–41 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2000. In 2014, Carlisle led the Mavericks back to the playoffs as the eighth seed with a 49–33 record where they would meet their in-state rivals San Antonio Spurs in the first round. The Mavericks lost the series in seven games as the Spurs went on to win the 2014 NBA Finals.[17] On January 30, 2015, he recorded his 600th win in a game against the Heat.[18] He signed a new five-year deal on November 5, 2015.[19] On December 2, 2017, Carlisle recorded his 700th win in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers.[20] Carlisle and his wife Donna have one daughter.[21] He is an avid pianist and private pilot, who as of September 2015 has logged nearly 200 hours flying his Cirrus SR22T single-engine light aircraft.[22][23]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/55.png

After graduating from Guilford College, Carr was selected by the Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association with the 7th pick of the 5th round of the 1973 NBA draft. However, he was one of the final roster cuts the Colonels made in camp, and was subsequently released.[1] The following season, Carr played in Israel for the American owned Israel Sabras in the short lived European Professional Basketball League.[2] For leading his team to the championship, leading the league in scoring, and emerging second in rebounding, he was named Most Valuable Player. During the 1975–76 ABA season, Carr played for the Spirits of St. Louis, averaging 12.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per game, and was named to the ABA's All-Rookie Team.[1] The Spirits of St. Louis were one of two ABA teams (the Colonels being the other) that did not join the NBA in the ABA–NBA merger,[1] and as a result Carr joined the NBA as a member of the Detroit Pistons from 1976–79. After being selected to the All-Defense second team during the 1979 season and leading the league in steals, Carr was signed as a free agent by the rebuilding Boston Celtics. Pistons coach Dick Vitale responded by saying, ""We just had the heart and soul ripped from our team."" The Carr acquisition was one of the four major additions which immediately propelled the Celtics back to the top of the NBA standings after finishing near the bottom the previous season, along with majority owner Harry Mangurian, head coach Bill Fitch and rookie forward Larry Bird. Carr was instrumental in leading the Celtics' defense past the favored Philadelphia 76ers in the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals, on the way to Boston's 14th NBA championship. Playing for the Celtics until 1985, Carr averaged 9.7 points and 4.3 rebounds per game during his NBA career. He is best known for the steal and dunk he made in overtime of Game 4 of the 1984 NBA Finals versus the Lakers in Los Angeles, which sealed the victory for Boston, and eventually won another title for them. He is also famous for waving a towel during crucial situations to fire up the Celtics.[3] Carr later became the General Manager of the Celtics in 1994. He later took over as coach for the 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons. In his last year as coach, the Celtics had the worst record in team history, winning just 15 games and losing 67 in a tactical effort to get a stronger draft position and poise the team for a comeback under famed college coach Rick Pitino.[citation needed] He was replaced at the end of season by Pitino, who was unable to restore the team to the glory of Carr's playing days. After the 1997 season, he became the Celtics' Director of Corporate Development. Carr later became president of the WNBA's Charlotte Sting as part of a failed attempt to become the owner of an expansion NBA team in Charlotte, along with Steve Belkin and former teammate Larry Bird. He was given a small investment stake in the Charlotte Bobcats when Bob Johnson was selected to have the NBA franchise in Charlotte. Subsequently, Bob Johnson sold the team and ML Carr no longer has a relationship with the Bobcat franchise. Carr currently resides in Massachusetts with his wife Sylvia, where he is a partner with New Technology Ventures - a tech-focused venture capital firm based in Newton, Massachusetts.[4]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/56.png

Carter broke his 5th metatarsal bone in his left foot and was physically unable to play for most of his first two years. He played guard at Indiana University from 1976 to 1980 and graduated with a degree in Marketing from the Kelly School of Business.

There, he improved the team from a previous losing record to an 18–3 record. He was acknowledged for this two-year turnaround by being named Ohio Basketball High School Coach of the Year. Carter is the only person to be named both Player and Coach of the Year in the state of Ohio.[1] Carter served as an assistant basketball coach at Long Beach State for Joe Harrington 1989. From 1990 to 1991, he was an assistant coach at the University of Dayton. Carter served as an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks from 1991 to 1996 under Frank Hamblen (1991) and Mike Dunleavy (1992–1996). He was promoted to the position of the Bucks scout in 1996–1997. During the 1997–1998 season, Carter served as an assistant coach for the Toronto Raptors under Darrell Walker. He was promoted to head coach midway through the 1997–1998 season after Walker resigned from the team with a franchise low 11–38 record. Carter finished the remainder of the season as interim Coach with a 5–28 record.[1] During the shortened 1998–99 NBA season, Carter coached the Raptors to a 23–27 record, improving the team's winning percentage by .308 from the all-time franchise low 16–66 season. Carter developed a reputation for developing young players, such as Rookie of the Year and NBA All-Star Vince Carter, and eventual NBA All-Star Tracy McGrady.[2] In the 1999–2000 season, Carter coached the Raptors to their first winning season (with a 45–37 record), resulting in the team's first playoff appearance. He became the first coach in NBA history to take a team from less than 20 wins to the playoffs in less than two years. However, the playoff berth was short-lived as the Raptors were eliminated in the first round by the Knicks.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/58.png

A 7'1"" (2.16 m) center, he played 16 seasons for the New York Knicks, Chicago Bulls and Seattle SuperSonics, helping the Bulls capture consecutive championships in 1991, 1992 and 1993. He attended Elk Grove High School in Elk Grove, California, and played college basketball at the University of San Francisco. In high school, Cartwright played basketball for the Elk Grove Thundering Herd under coach Dan Risley. In 1974 and 1975, he was named California High School State Basketball Player of the Year. In 1975, he was named California High School Sports Athlete of the Year. On March 6–8, 1975, Cartwright's Elk Grove High School team won the 29th Annual Tournament Of Champions in Oakland (predecessor of the California Interscholastic Federation State Basketball Championship). As a prep star, Cartwright was just as highly regarded as fellow preps Darryl Dawkins and Bill Willoughby.[citation needed] Cartwright played college ball at the University of San Francisco and was a consensus second team all-American in 1977 and 1979. During his time at USF, Cartwright played on one of the tallest starting lineups in collegiate history. He graduated as the all-time leading scorer for the Dons, averaging 19.1 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. Cartwright led San Francisco to three trips to the NCAA tournament, to the first round in the 1977 and to the Sweet Sixteen in both 1978 and 1979. [3] Cartwright was the third overall pick in the 1979 NBA draft selected by the New York Knicks, making his only career All-Star Game appearance that season. He averaged more than 20 points per game in his first two seasons for the Knicks, but after playing no fewer than 77 games in his first five seasons, a series of foot injuries caused him to miss the entire 1985–86 season,[1] prompting the Knicks to draft center Patrick Ewing with the number-one overall pick and relegate Cartwright to his backup.[2] However, ongoing foot problems limited Cartwright to only two appearances during the 1986–87 season. On June 27, 1988, Cartwright was traded to the Chicago Bulls for forward Charles Oakley.[3] The Bulls were willing to part with Oakley, the league's second-leading rebounder in the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons, because of their need for a center and the rapid development of power forward Horace Grant.[4] Cartwright was the Bulls' starting center during their first string of three consecutive NBA championships in 1991, 1992 and 1993. During the 1992–93 season, Cartwright took an elbow to the throat during a regular-season game against the Indiana Pacers that fractured his larynx and left him with a hoarse voice.[5] The Bulls, who were without Michael Jordan the following season following his retirement, made the 1994 NBA Playoffs but were eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Knicks. Cartwright departed the team thereafter as an unrestricted free agent. Cartwright left the Bulls as a free agent and signed with the Seattle SuperSonics. He only played in 29 games for the Sonics, and retired after the 1994–95 NBA season. A few years after his retirement, Cartwright was added to the Bulls once again as an assistant coach under Phil Jackson, and the team was once again in the playoffs, winning the title in 1997 and 1998. The Bulls went through significant changes following the 1997–98 season, with not only Jordan and Pippen leaving, but Tim Floyd taking over as head coach from Jackson. The Bulls had a lengthy rebuilding effort, and Cartwright took over the Bulls 27 games into the 2001–02 season, going 17-38 after the team's 4-23 start under Floyd and interim head coach Bill Berry, the latter whom coached for two games before Cartwright was named interim head coach. The Bulls finished 21-61 on the year and the following season Cartwright was promoted from interim to permanent head coach. In the 2002–03 season the Bulls finished 30-52, but Cartwright would last only 14 games into the 2003–04 season — going 4-10 — before being fired.[6] Pete Myers and finally Scott Skiles coached the Bulls immediately following Cartwright's tenure. In 2004, the New Jersey Nets hired Cartwright as an assistant coach under Lawrence Frank. In 2008, Cartwright was named as an assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns under Terry Porter. Suns general manager Steve Kerr hired the former big man to help coach veteran big man Shaquille O'Neal, all-star Amar'e Stoudemire, and upcoming draft picks.[7] After the Suns dismissed Porter and promoted assistant Alvin Gentry, Cartwright stayed on as assistant coach with the team. In January 2013, Cartwright was hired to coach Osaka Evessa in Japan.[8][9][10] In September 2014, Cartwright was hired as the head coach of the Mexico National Basketball Team. Cartwright married his junior high school sweetheart, Sheri, and together they have four children Justin, Jason, James and Kristin.

He is a former NCAA basketball player and coach, having played and coached there for over a decade before moving on to the NBA.[1] Dwane Lyndon Casey was born on April 17, 1957 in Indianapolis, Indiana.[2] However, his family moved to Morganfield, Kentucky when he was three years old.[3] Casey graduated from Union County High School in 1975.[4] Casey was a top recruit coming out of high school. He made the decision to commit to the University of Kentucky. During the 1977-78 Wildcats season, Casey helped guide the team to an NCAA Tournament Championship. He served as team captain during his senior year. During the summers, Casey worked several odd jobs to support himself, including coal mining and tobacco farming.[5] He graduated from the University of Kentucky with a degree in business administration in 1979, also receiving Kentucky's All-Academic Award that same year.[6] Casey's coaching experience went back to his first coaching job at the age of 13 when Morganfield Baseball Commissioner Earl McKendree allowed the young Casey to coach a Little League team with kids just three years younger than him. He began his college coaching career in 1979 due to a suggestion made by his coach Joe B. Hall. Casey spent a season with Hall as an assistant coach at Kentucky. The next season, Casey made the move to Western Kentucky, where he spent the next five seasons. Casey later returned to Kentucky in 1985 where he would take the role of an assistant coach and top recruiter.[7] In late March 1988 while still serving as an assistant coach at Kentucky, Emery Worldwide employees discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope that was accidentally opened. The envelope was addressed to Claud Mills, the father of recruit Chris Mills, and the sender was identified as Casey. The University of Kentucky said that the evidence collected during the investigation was inconclusive, and did not prove that Casey sent the money.[8] [9] The scandal resulted in Casey's resignation, and Casey was then placed on probation for 5 years by the NCAA.[10] The NCAA later rescinded the penalty after it was shown that Casey wasn't involved in sending the package.[11] Casey also settled outside of court in a defamation suit against Emery Worldwide. The case was originally for $6.9 million.[12] After his resignation from Kentucky, Casey accepted a head coaching job in the Japanese Basketball League. During his time there, Casey coached for Sekisui Chemical and Isuzu Motors Lynx that his teammate Jack Givens played for. While in Japan, Casey did coaching work for the national team alongside longtime friend Mototaka Kohama and veteran coach Pete Newell.[13] During the summers, Casey continued to work with the Japanese national team. In the summer of 1998 the team appeared in the FIBA World Championship basketball tournament, which would be the team's first appearance there in over 30 years.[6] Casey left the Japanese Basketball League in 1994 after receiving an assistant coaching position for the Seattle SuperSonics. During his tenure in Seattle, the team won four division titles. At the beginning of the 2005–06 NBA season, Casey landed his first job as head coach for the Minnesota Timberwolves, replacing Kevin McHale. Casey's overall record with the team was 53–69, and he was fired on January 23, 2007, after only a season and a half with the Timberwolves.[14] At the time of his firing, the Timberwolves were 20–20, he was replaced by assistant coach Randy Wittman, who went 12–30 for the rest of the season.[15] During the 2008–09 NBA season Casey served as an assistant coach for the Dallas Mavericks. During the 2009–10 NBA season, the Mavericks won a division title. In 2011, the Mavericks defeated the Miami Heat in the 2011 NBA Finals and won their first championship. LeBron James of the Heat would later admit that Casey's defensive schemes for Dallas helped make him improve his game even further after that series.[16] In early June 2011, the Toronto Raptors decided not to pick up the option on Jay Triano's contract. Casey was named the new Raptors head coach on June 21 and would run through until the 2013–14 season.[17] Casey's first two seasons with the Raptors involved little to no success. The team exceeded expectations in the first season and underachieved in the second. The team failed to make the playoffs both seasons. During his third season with the team, it managed to set a new team record for most wins in a season, an Atlantic Division Championship, and its first playoff appearance in six years. On May 6, 2014, a day after being eliminated from the playoffs, Casey and the Raptors agreed to a three-year contract extension.[18] On November 1, 2015, Casey surpassed Sam Mitchell's franchise record for wins getting his 157th against Milwaukee Bucks with the score of 106–87.[19] On March 18, 2016, Casey became the first Raptors head coach to reach 200 wins with the franchise in a win over the Indiana Pacers with the score of 101–94[20] and twelve days later, in a 105–97 win over the Atlanta Hawks, he coached the Raptors to its first 50 win season in franchise history.[21] On May 1, 2016, Casey coached the Raptors to their first Game 7 victory in franchise history with an 89–84 win over the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the 2016 NBA Playoffs and on May 15,he coached the Raptors to their first appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals in franchise history with a 116–89 victory over the Miami Heat in the second round of the playoffs where they fell to the eventual NBA champions Cleveland Cavaliers in six games.[22][23] On June 7, he agreed with the Raptors to a contract extension.[24] On January 28, 2018, Casey became the first coach in Raptors' history to be selected for the NBA All-Star Game.[25] On February 11, 2018, He celebrated his 300th win as a coach for the Raptors.[26] Casey's Raptors set franchise records for wins and points in the regular season as they finished first in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Raptors defeated the Washington Wizards in six games and were then swept in four games by the Cleveland Cavaliers led by LeBron James.[27] On May 11, 2018, Casey was fired as the Raptors' head coach,[28] shortly after being named NBCA Coach of the Year.[29] He was named the NBA Coach of the Year at the 2018 NBA Awards.[30] On June 11, 2018, Casey was named the head coach for the Detroit Pistons, agreeing to a five-year deal.[31][32] On November 14, 2018, Casey returned to Scotiabank Arena for the first time since being fired by the Toronto Raptors,[33] coaching the Pistons to a 106–104 win over his former team.

One of the strongest backcourt players of the 1940s and 1950s, he was always assigned to defend against the opposing team's best scoring threat. He earned the nickname ""Digger"" because of his hard-nosed style of defense.[1] Born in Buffalo, New York, Cervi attended East High School in his hometown, where he captained the baseball and basketball teams and achieved All-City honors in both sports. He dropped out of school after his junior year when he was recruited by the Buffalo Bisons of the newly formed NBL.[2] He played in all of the Bisons' nine games in 1937–38, the franchise's only season of existence.[3] He never attended college. Instead, he served five years in the United States Army Air Forces from 1940 through 1945.[1][4] After the conclusion of World War II, he joined the Rochester Royals, another NBL franchise entering its first year of operations. He immediately experienced success as the team captured the 1945–46 league title after sweeping the best-of-five championship series from the Sheboygan Red Skins. The Royals returned to the finals the following two seasons, but lost to the Chicago American Gears and Minneapolis Lakers in four games each.[3] Cervi made the All-NBL First Team in 1947 and 1948.[5] In the first of those two campaigns, he was the leading scorer with 632 points.[1][3] His time with the Royals lasted only three seasons.[3] After discovering that other teammates were being paid more than his $7,500 annual salary, he requested a $3,500 raise, which was denied by team owner Les Harrison. As a result, instead of moving with the Royals to the Basketball Association of America (BAA) after the 1948 campaign, Cervi stayed in the NBL and joined the Syracuse Nationals, who met his salary demands and appointed him player-coach.[1][3] Besides being named to the All-NBL First Team for a third straight year in 1949, he also earned Coach of the Year honors. After the BAA-NBL merger to form the NBA prior to the 1949–50 campaign, he continued to serve in the dual capacity role until his retirement as an active player in 1953.[5] The Syracuse teams he piloted took on his relentlessly competitive nature. He played a major role in the development of Dolph Schayes.[6] The Nationals qualified for the playoffs in eight of the nine seasons that he coached the ballclub, including three trips to the NBA Finals. They were twice defeated by the Lakers, first in six games in 1950 and then in seven in 1954. The pinnacle of Cervi's coaching career was leading his squad to the NBA Championship over the Fort Wayne Pistons in seven games in 1955.[5] When the Nationals began the 1956–57 campaign at 4–8, he was replaced by team captain Paul Seymour.[7] Cervi succeeded George Senesky as coach of the Philadelphia Warriors in 1958,[8] but left after one season to accept a more lucrative job in the trucking business as an area manager for Eastern Freightways, Inc. in Rochester, New York. In 1960 he declined to accept a two-year offer to coach the Lakers in its first campaign in Los Angeles because his wife was reluctant to leave the Rochester area. He lived in the suburb of Brighton for the last 58 years of his life.[1] Cervi was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1985.[9] He received similar honors from the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.[10] He died on November 9, 2009 in Rochester, New York at the age of 92.[4] Cervi was featured in the book, Basketball History in Syracuse, Hoops Roots by author Mark Allen Baker published by The History Press in 2010.

Cheeks was an all-Missouri Valley Conference player for three straight seasons, as he averaged 16.8 points per game and shot nearly 57% for his collegiate career. He is the third leading scorer in WTSU/WTAM history. After college, Cheeks was selected as the 36th pick in the second round of the 1978 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. He played 15 years as a point guard in the NBA, including 11 with the Philadelphia 76ers, He earned four trips to the NBA All-Star Game, and he helped the 76ers to three trips to the NBA Finals in a four-year span in the early 1980s (1980, 1982, and 1983), including an NBA championship in 1983. While starting at point guard for a Sixers team that at times included stars Julius Erving, Moses Malone, Andrew Toney, and Charles Barkley, Cheeks was well regarded for his team play and defensive skills. He was named to four straight NBA All-Defensive squads from 1983 to 1986, and earned a spot on the second team in 1987. In NBA history, Cheeks ranks fifth in steals and eleventh in assists. Upon his retirement from the NBA in 1993, he was the NBA all-time leader in steals and fifth in assists.[1] He averaged 11.7 points and over 2 steals per game for his career. In his rookie year, Cheeks averaged 4.1 steals per game in the 1979 NBA Playoffs, an NBA record for one playoff run.[2] After retirement, Cheeks spent one year coaching for the Continental Basketball Association’s Quad City Thunder,[3] before becoming the 76ers assistant head coach in 1994. He coached under head coaches John Lucas (1994–96), Johnny Davis (1996–97), and Larry Brown, and he was an instrumental part of the Philadelphia team that reached the 2001 NBA Finals. In 2001, he was hired as Portland Trail Blazers head coach. He led the team to two playoff berths in four years as coach, but could not get past the first round. He was fired after a poor start to the 2004–05 campaign. On April 25, 2003, during a game between the Trail Blazers and the Dallas Mavericks, Cheeks aided 13-year-old Natalie Gilbert in singing the American national anthem. After Gilbert forgot the words at ""At the twilight's last gleaming"", Cheeks rushed over to help her and they finished it together, as the entire Rose Garden Arena crowd sang with them. Cheeks and Gilbert received a standing ovation after the song was over.[4] In 2005, Cheeks was named as head coach of the 76ers. Cheeks was popular among Sixers fans because of his eleven-year tenure with the Sixers, during which he helped guide the Sixers to the 1983 NBA championship. The move was also praised by Sixers star Allen Iverson, who worked with Cheeks during his run as Sixers' Assistant Head Coach.[5] However, he missed the playoffs in each of his first two seasons. Frustrations began to grow with Sixers veterans Allen Iverson and Chris Webber, who were not happy with the team's direction. During the 2006–07 season, Iverson would be traded to the Nuggets and Webber would be released, leaving Cheeks with one of the youngest teams in the NBA. On February 20, 2007, the 76ers extended Cheeks' contract one year despite his losing record as coach. At the beginning of the 2007–08 season, expectations were low and the 76ers were picked to finish last in the Conference by many prognosticators.[6] However, the Sixers clinched a playoff berth with a win over the Atlanta Hawks on April 4, 2008.[7] It was their first postseason appearance since 2005, as well as the first in the post-Iverson era. However, they were eliminated by the Detroit Pistons, 4–2. Even with this elimination, many fans considered this to be a successful season, considering that the Sixers were 12 games under .500 in early February and went on to have a 21–7 run that led them to the playoffs.[8] The Sixers started out the 2008–09 NBA season 9–14, despite their signing of Elton Brand and re-signing of Andre Iguodala during the offseason. Due to their slow start, the 76ers fired Cheeks on December 13, 2008.[9] On August 14, 2009, he was hired as an assistant coach for the Oklahoma City Thunder.[10] On June 10, 2013, Cheeks agreed to become the head coach of the Detroit Pistons.[11] On February 9, 2014, the Detroit Pistons relieved him of his head coaching duties and replaced him with John Loyer on an interim basis for the remainder of the season.[12] On June 29, 2015, Cheeks returned to the Thunder as an assistant coach.[13] On September 7, 2018, Cheeks was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a player.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/66.png

He previously was the head coach of the Charlotte Hornets. Born in Island Falls, Maine, Clifford grew up in Mattawamkeag, Maine, until the third grade, when he moved to Vermont.[1] He played varsity basketball under Gerald Clifford, his father and head coach at North Country Union High School in Newport, Vermont.[2][3] Clifford attended the University of Maine at Farmington, where he played college basketball for four years. In his final two seasons, he was team captain and was named Best Defensive Player. He graduated with a degree in special education.[4] After graduating from college, Clifford became a teacher at Woodland High School in Maine. He also gained his first coaching experience at the school, serving as their head coach for two seasons while leading them to two tournaments.[2][5] He then served as an assistant coach at St. Anselm's College, Fairfield University, Boston University and Siena College. In 1995, he assumed the head coaching duties at Adelphi University and coached for four seasons under Keith Dickson, leading their team to four appearances in the NCAA Division II Tournament, an 86–36 (.705) record and four consecutive 20-win seasons; he was the first coach in the school's history with back-to-back 20-plus win seasons.[5] Clifford became an NBA assistant coach with the New York Knicks and Houston Rockets under Jeff Van Gundy and quickly developed a reputation as a defensive expert. He then was an assistant for Stan Van Gundy with the Orlando Magic.[2] He considers both the Van Gundy brothers as mentors.[6] He reached the NBA Playoffs in each of his five seasons with Orlando, appearing in the NBA Finals in 2009. Clifford then joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2012–13 as an assistant. On May 29, 2013, Clifford was hired by the Charlotte Bobcats to be their head coach.[7] Clifford implemented a defensive mentality in Charlotte during his first year as head coach turning the Charlotte Bobcats into a top five defensive team when in the years prior to his tenure they ranked near the bottom of the NBA in that category. He led the Bobcats to the 2014 NBA playoffs in his first year as head coach, during which he coached the Bobcats to a 43–39 record. The two years prior to him joining the Bobcats only had a combined total of 28 wins. He was named Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for April 2014 after he led the Bobcats to a 7–1 record leading to the playoffs. He finished fourth in Coach of the Year voting in his first year. On December 6, 2017, it was announced that Clifford would not coach indefinitely to deal with his health issue.[8][9] On January 11, 2018, the Hornets announced that Clifford was medically cleared to return to coaching[10] after a 21-game absence after dealing with sleep deprivation.[11] After the 2017–18 regular season, he was fired as head coach on April 13, 2018, after five seasons coaching the team to a 196–214 record total.[12] On May 30, 2018, Clifford was named the head coach of the Orlando Magic.[13] The Magic started the 2018–19 season by splitting their first 24 games before falling 11 games under .500 after a 126–117 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.[14] Despite the dismal start, Clifford led the Magic on a dramatic turnaround.

He formerly owned the Phoenix Suns of the NBA, the Phoenix Mercury of the WNBA, the Arizona Sandsharks of the Continental Indoor Soccer League, the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League and the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball. He was also instrumental in the relocation of the original Winnipeg Jets team in the NHL to Phoenix to become the Phoenix Coyotes (now the Arizona Coyotes). In 2014, Grand Canyon University renamed its Christian based school of business after Jerry Colangelo, replacing Ken Blanchard's namesake.[1] From December 2015 to April 2016, Colangelo served as Chairman of Basketball Operations for the Philadelphia 76ers, before serving as a special adviser to the team until December 2018. He became the youngest general manager in professional sports in 1968 after being hired as general manager for the Phoenix Suns. He has the second longest tenure running the same NBA franchise, exceeded only by Red Auerbach of the Boston Celtics.[2] In the summer of 2005, Colangelo was named director of USA Basketball whose team represented the United States in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2010 FIBA World Championship. Since 2009, he has served as Chairman of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[3] Colangelo also serves as Chairman of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF), a nonprofit nonpartisan educational foundation that promotes Italian American culture and heritage. Colangelo was born and raised in Chicago Heights, Illinois, to an Italian-American working class family.[4] He played basketball and baseball for Bloom Township High School. Colangelo enrolled at the University of Kansas, but transferred to the University of Illinois after prospective teammate Wilt Chamberlain left. He played basketball for the Illinois Fighting Illini, earned All-Big Ten honors, and captained the Illini as a senior. He was later inducted into the Illinois Basketball Hall of Fame. Colangelo also played two years of baseball at Illinois.[5] In 1962, he graduated from the University of Illinois with a degree in physical education.[4] In his autobiography, How You Play the Game, Colangelo tells of working after graduating college at the House of Charles, a tuxedo rental shop in Chicago Heights.[6] Colangelo began his sports career in 1966 in professional basketball with the Chicago Bulls. He worked as a marketing director, scout, and assistant to the president of the team.[7] In 1968, he left the Bulls and was hired as the first general manager of the expansion team, the Phoenix Suns. He was the youngest general manager in professional sports.[8] When he and his family left for Arizona, he had $200 in his wallet.[6] Colangelo got off to an unlucky start, losing a 1969 coin flip to the Milwaukee Bucks for the rights to UCLA phenom Lew Alcindor (who became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). The Suns were competitive during most of the 1970s, making it to the NBA Finals in 1976, but losing to the Boston Celtics in six games. Colangelo had two stints as head coach during that decade, compiling a record of 59 wins and 60 losses. Throughout most of the 1980s, Colangelo's Suns faced difficulties. Some players, including 1976 NBA Finals player Garfield Heard, were involved in an infamous drug scandal, young center Nick Vanos died in a 1987 plane crash, and, from 1985 through 1988, the Suns failed to qualify for the playoffs. Colangelo assembled a group of investors that bought the Suns in late 1987, in the wake of the drug scandal. He subsequently made a trade for Kevin Johnson in 1987. The Suns made one of the biggest turnarounds in NBA history in 1988–89, nearly doubling their win total (from 28 wins to 55) and making the first of 13 straight playoff appearances. In 1989, Colangelo was an essential part of the group that provided financial backing to build America West Arena (renamed Talking Stick Resort Arena). In 1992, Colangelo traded Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry, and Andrew Lang to the Philadelphia 76ers for Charles Barkley. The trade proved to be productive for the Suns, and they reached the NBA Finals for the second time in 1993, this time losing to the Chicago Bulls starring Michael Jordan in six games. Barkley's relationship with Colangelo, however, grew sour over the years, and in 1996, he was traded to the Houston Rockets. Throughout his time with the Suns, Colangelo would win four different NBA Executive of the Year honors with the team. It would stand to be the most honors for an executive of one team in the NBA. He eventually turned over the Suns' presidency to his son Bryan, who later left the organization to become general manager of the Toronto Raptors. Bryan ended up winning two NBA Executive of the Year honors: one with Phoenix, and one with Toronto only two seasons later. On December 7, 2015, Colangelo decided to return to the NBA to become the new chairman of basketball operations for the Philadelphia 76ers,[9] as well as special adviser to the team's managing partner.[10] On April 7, 2016, Colangelo's son, Bryan, took on the role of general manager and president of basketball operations for the 76ers after their former president and general manager, Sam Hinkie, resigned from his position before end of the 2015-16 season due to irreconcilable differences with Jerry.[11] The move reunited the Colangelos for the first time since 2004 with the Phoenix Suns. Colangelo stepped down as Chairman of Basketball Operations following the hiring of his son, but he retained his role as special adviser to the managing partner.[12] Just before his son's later resignation from the position of general manager, Colangelo attempted to save Bryan's job by threatening to damage the team's NBA relationships.[13] On July 30, 2018, it was revealed that he would stay with Philadelphia for the rest of the year but will retire effective in 2019. Colangelo has been involved in many professional sports teams in Arizona. While in Chicago for a Suns game, Colangelo attended a Chicago Cubs baseball game at Wrigley Field. Soon thereafter he decided to inquire to Major League Baseball about bringing an expansion team to Arizona. He assembled a group of investors in 1994 to buy a franchise, a year ahead of MLB's proposed expansion selection meetings. In 1995, Colangelo's group was granted an expansion team, the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Diamondbacks began playing in 1998. For his new baseball club, Colangelo hired Joe Garagiola, Jr. as General Manager. He next brought in Buck Showalter coming off a successful stint as manager of the New York Yankees. Showalter and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner did not agree to a contract extension, so Colangelo quickly hired Showalter as future manager of the Diamondbacks. These hirings proved to be instrumental to the expansion franchise's quick success. Key acquisitions made by Garagiola included the signing of Randy Johnson in 1999 and a trade for Curt Schilling in 2000 from the Philadelphia Phillies. They were co-MVPs of the 2001 World Series when the Diamondbacks beat the Yankees in seven games. This is, as of 2019[update], the only major professional sports championship for the Phoenix area. The Diamondbacks had gone into significant debt to build the 2001 champions. For example, he asked 12 of the highest-paid players to defer their salaries for four years and repay them over eight years.[14]}} The ensuing debt came back to haunt the Diamondbacks in 2004. Only three years after winning the World Series and two years after winning a third division title in three years, the Diamondbacks never recovered from a slow start and were out of contention by the end of May. They ultimately finished 51-111, the worst record in baseball and easily the worst in franchise history. By then, Colangelo was gone. He was forced to resign as Managing General Partner in the summer of 2004, and subsequently sold his interest. Ken Kendrick succeeded him as managing general partner, while Jeff Moorad became CEO and operating head of the franchise. In an interview with USA Today, Colangelo defended his approach to building the Diamondbacks, saying that he was only trying to build a winning team. He contrasted his approach with that of the Diamondbacks' expansion brethren, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who at the time had finished in either last or next-to-last every season (and would not have a winning season until 2008). He claimed that the plan only backfired when the economy went sour and he didn't get as much from baseball's central fund as anticipated.[14] In 1997, Colangelo's team in the Women's National Basketball Association, the Phoenix Mercury, began playing. The following year, the Mercury reached the WNBA Finals but lost to the Houston Comets. In 1992, Colangelo founded the Arena Football League's Arizona Rattlers and owned them until 2005. Under Colangelo's guidance, the Rattlers won Arena Bowl championships in 1994 and 1997. They were also one of the AFL's model franchises and were a perennial playoff team. According to published reports, the Rattlers struggled to stay afloat as a franchise after Colangelo sold the team.[15] Colangelo was also involved in bringing the National Hockey League (NHL) to Arizona, transferring the Winnipeg Jets to the area as the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996. The move made Phoenix one of 13 metropolitan areas with franchises in all four major North American professional sports leagues). The team plays in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale. In April 2004, Colangelo sold the Suns, Mercury and Rattlers to an investment group headed by San Diego, California businessman, Tucson, Arizona native Robert Sarver for $401 million. Late in the 2004 baseball season, Colangelo sold his controlling interest in the Arizona Diamondbacks to a group of investors led by Jeff Moorad.[16] Jerry Colangelo is part of an investment group planning development in Buckeye, Arizona. They have planned a 300,000+ residence development called Douglas Ranch and a smaller 7,000 acres (30 km2) development called Trillium.[17] Colangelo purchased the bankrupt Wigwam Resort in Litchfield Park, Arizona. In 2011, Jerry Colangelo assisted in creating Grand Canyon University's Colangelo School of Sports Business and served as an advisor. On September 25, 2014, Grand Canyon University announced their college of business would be renamed Colangelo College of Business.[18] Colangelo has been named the NBA's Executive of the Year four times (1976, 1981, 1989, 1993). He is an honorary member of the Marchegiana Society of his hometown, Chicago Heights, Illinois. A street in that city bears his name. On May 9, 2002, Colangelo was awarded an honorary degree from Arizona State University. On April 4, 2004, Colangelo was elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.[19] On November 4, 2007, Colangelo was inducted into the Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor at the halftime of a Suns game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. He is the National Leadership Director of the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame and is also a Hall of Fame inductee.[2] It is located in the Colangelo Building on Taylor Street in Little Italy, Chicago. On Saturday, May 18, 2019, The Lincoln Academy of Illinois granted Colangelo the Order of Lincoln award, the highest honor bestowed by the State of Illinois.[20] Colangelo is a Christian. Colangelo has spoken about his faith saying, ""The first priority in life is to have that relationship with Jesus Christ. So your faith is number one. ... God [has] a plan for my life. You know, the way I've tried to live my life is I have this platform, it was given to me by the Lord. And He's blessed me with a lot of things. And someday I'm going to be held accountable with what I did with those things.""[21] Colangelo is married to Joan, whom he met on a blind date while at college.[5] They have four children: Kathy Holcombe, Kristen Young, Mandie Colangelo, and Bryan Colangelo.[4] Bryan was also the President of the Toronto Raptors until 2013, before joining his father again with the Philadelphia 76ers in April 2016. Bryan Colangelo gained the job after the previous post holder, Sam Hinkie, resigned. After the hiring of his son Bryan Colangelo as General Manager and President of Basketball Operations, Jerry Colangelo stepped down from his role, while maintaining a job as a special adviser to the team. However, with the resignation of his son in 2018, Jerry would only serve with the team throughout the rest of that year before leaving, effectively in 2019.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/71.png

He was the first overall pick of the 1973 NBA draft and a four-time NBA All-Star. He has been an NBA coach, coaching the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, Washington Wizards and Philadelphia 76ers. Collins also served as an analyst for various NBA-related broadcast shows.[1] He is a recipient of the Curt Gowdy Media Award. Collins was born in Christopher, Illinois.[2] He grew up in Benton, Illinois, where his next-door neighbour was future film star John Malkovich. Collins enjoyed a successful high school basketball career at Benton Consolidated High School, under renowned coach Rich Herrin, after which he went on to play for Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois, coached from 1970 by Will Robinson, the first black head coach in NCAA Division I basketball.[3] Collins was drafted first overall in the 1973 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. He played eight seasons for Philadelphia, and was an all star three times. In 1976–77, he joined Julius Erving leading the Sixers to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Portland Trail Blazers.[citation needed] A rash of injuries[4] to his feet and left knee beginning in 1979, would end Collins' career in 1981. In all, he played 415 NBA games, scoring 7427 points (17.9 per game). After his retirement, Collins turned to coaching. He joined Bob Weinhauer's staff at the University of Pennsylvania as an assistant coach and later followed Weinhauer to Arizona State for the same job.[5] In May 1986, Collins was named head coach of the Chicago Bulls;[6] the team featured a young Michael Jordan who was entering his third season. Despite having Jordan, the Bulls were coming off a 30-52 season and fired their past two coaches after one season each.[7] Collins immediately helped the Bulls turn around their fortunes, showing an improvement of 10 games in each of his first two seasons, coaching Chicago to a 50-32 record in his second year. In his third year as coach, he brought Chicago to their first Eastern Conference Finals Appearance in 15 years,[8] however, they were unable to get past their Central Division rival the ""Bad Boys"" Detroit Pistons. Despite the Bulls' success and his popularity in Chicago, Collins was fired in the summer of 1989.[9] Collins was named the head coach of the Detroit Pistons in 1995. His arrival in Detroit was similar to his in Chicago, as the Pistons had a second-year star who drew comparisons to Michael Jordan, Grant Hill. In his first season, he was able to improve the team's previous season's record by 18 games and lead them back to the playoffs, though they would be swept by the Orlando Magic.[10] A fast start in his second season pushed Hill to the top of MVP consideration and Collins was named the Eastern Conference All-Star team's coach.[11] The highlight of the year for Collins came on April 13, when the Pistons defeated the defending champion Bulls to end Detroit's 19-game losing streak against Chicago.[12] (Ironically Collins ended a Chicago losing streak against the Pistons in the 80's.)[13] The Pistons finished 54-28 and lost in the first round of playoffs to the Atlanta Hawks, 3–2 in the best-of-five series. He served as Pistons' head coach until February 2, 1998, when he was fired and replaced by Alvin Gentry. Collins then became a television broadcaster, working for many years at various networks, such as NBC on the NBA on NBC and TNT on the NBA on TNT. He worked as a broadcaster for about three years before being hired to coach the Washington Wizards for the start of the 2001–02 NBA season. In Washington, Collins was reunited with Michael Jordan and Charles Oakley. Once again, in his first season with his new team, Collins improved the team's previous season's record by 18 games.[14] Though his .451 winning percentage through 2 seasons was better than the Wizards' .308 record the previous 2 seasons (and subsequent .305 record the following season),[14] Collins was fired at the conclusion of the 2002–03 season. On May 21, 2010, Collins was hired as head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers.[15] While the 76ers initially started out poorly with a record of 3-13, the team showed great improvement as the season went on, and clinched the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference for the playoffs. Under Collins, the team increased its win total by 14 games over the previous season. They lost to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat in the first round, but were able to avoid a sweep that had been predicted. Collins finished second in Coach of the Year voting that season.[16] In the lockout-shortened 2011–2012 season, Collins led the Sixers to an improved record, but Philadelphia was only able to take the eighth seed in the playoffs. Against the top seeded Chicago Bulls, Collins led the Sixers to their first playoff series victory since 2003. It was the fifth time in NBA history that an eighth seed defeated a first seed in a playoff series. They took the next series against the Boston Celtics to seven games, but lost. Collins resigned as 76ers coach on April 18, 2013, citing a need to spend more time with his five grandchildren.[17][18] It was announced that he would stay with the team as an adviser.[19] Collins represented the United States at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany. Those basketball games are remembered by U.S. fans mainly for the controversial gold medal basketball game between the United States and the Soviet Union, in which Collins played a key part. Collins started doing work for CBS in the mid-1980s, calling mostly playoff games. He also was the lead color analyst for the local broadcasts of the 76ers' games during the 1985–86 season. In-between his various coaching stints he has done broadcasting work for CBS, NBC, TNT, TBS, and ABC/ESPN. After being fired by the Wizards, Collins returned to announcing games for TNT. In addition, he served as an analyst for NBC Sports' TV coverage of basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.[20] He also was a basketball analyst for NBC during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[21] During this time, Collins's name surfaced several times regarding head coaching vacancies. In 2005, he was a candidate for the Milwaukee Bucks job but was passed over for Terry Stotts.[22] Collins was approached by the team again in 2008 to serve as their GM and coach but turned them down again.[22] In May 2008, Collins was in negotiations to coach the Chicago Bulls, nearly 20 years after he was fired from the team.[23] However, Collins withdrew his name when he and owner Jerry Reinsdorf ""agreed it wasn't the best to keep going this way,"" in light of their close personal friendship.[24] On September 19, 2017, the Chicago Bulls announced that Collins has joined the team as senior advisor of basketball operations.[25] Doug and his wife Kathy have two children. They reside in the Delaware Valley. Their son Chris, a former Duke University basketball player, is the head basketball coach at Northwestern University and their daughter Kelly, who played basketball at Lehigh University, is a school teacher in Pennsylvania.

He has also coached in the NBA, WNBA, and the NBA Development League.[2] Cooper is the only person to win a championship, as either a coach or a player, in the NBA and the NBA D-League.[3] Cooper was born in Los Angeles. When he was three years old, he cut one of his knees severely, requiring 100 stitches to close. At the time the doctor said that he would never be able to walk.[4] He attended Pasadena High School, graduating in 1974, then Pasadena City College before transferring to the University of New Mexico. He played for the New Mexico Lobos for two seasons, 1976–78,[5] and was named first team All-Western Athletic Conference. In his senior season the Lobos won the WAC title, with Cooper averaging 16.3 points, 5.7 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game. Selected by the Los Angeles Lakers in the third round of the 1978 NBA draft with the 60th overall pick,[6] Cooper became an integral part of their Showtime teams of the 1980s with his defensive skills. In a twelve-year career, he was named to eight NBA All Defensive Teams, including five First Teams. He won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1987. He, along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, was a member of five Lakers championship teams in 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988.[7] At 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m), 174 lb (77 kg), the rail-thin Cooper known for his knee-high socks, played shooting guard, small forward, and point guard, although his defensive assignment was usually the other team's best shooter at the 2 or 3 position.

A popular player among Lakers fans, home crowds were known to chant, ""Coooooooop"" whenever he controlled the ball, and the Lakers sometimes ran an alley-oop play for him that was dubbed the ""Coop-a-loop.""[9] Leaving the team after the 1989–90 season, he was ranked among the club's all-time top 10 in three-point field goals (428), games played (873), total minutes played (23,635), steals (1033), blocked shots (523), assists (3,666), defensive rebounds (2,028), offensive rebounds (741) and free throw percentage (.833). He then played for the 1990–91 season in Italy for Pallacanestro Virtus Roma in the Italian Serie A, averaging 15.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.9 steals, 1.8 assists, and 0.3 blocks per game. Following his playing career, he served as Special Assistant to Lakers' general manager Jerry West for three years before joining the Lakers' coaching staff in March 1994 under Magic Johnson, then with Del Harris from 1994–97. He became an assistant coach of the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks in 1999, and helped the team reach the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, with a record of 20-12. He was named the Sparks' head coach in November 1999, and the Sparks' record quickly improved, as they finished 28-4 in their 2000 campaign. Cooper was named the WNBA Coach of the Year for his efforts. The Sparks followed with consecutive WNBA Championships in 2001 and 2002, but were denied a third straight WNBA title by losing to the Detroit Shock in 2003. After the Sacramento Monarchs ended the Sparks' run in the first round of the 2004 WNBA Playoffs, Cooper took a job as an assistant coach under Jeff Bzdelik with the Denver Nuggets. After 24 games, Bzedlik was fired, and Cooper was named the Nuggets' interim head coach.[10] He remained interim head coach until George Karl was brought in to coach the team about a month later and served as a scout for the Nuggets the remainder of the season. Cooper was the head coach of the Albuquerque Thunderbirds for two years (2006–07). In 2007, he left the Thunderbirds after coaching them to the National Basketball Association D- League Championship in 2006. Cooper then returned to coaching in the WNBA as head coach of the Los Angeles Sparks. In May 2009, Cooper was named head coach of the University of Southern California's Women of Troy Basketball Team.[11] He quit in 2013 after USC went 11–20 and finished seventh in the Pac-12 Conference with a 7–11 record. He was 72–57 overall at USC.[12] In November 2013, Cooper was hired by the Atlanta Dream as head coach.[13] In July 2014, Cooper was diagnosed with early-stage tongue cancer. He had surgery at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University in Atlanta, and a full recovery was expected. His contract was not renewed by Atlanta after an 11–22 season in 2017. In 2018, Cooper signed on to coach 3's Company of the Big3 League. In 2019, Cooper was named the boys varsity coach at Chadwick School in the Palos Verdes Peninsula of Los Angeles County.[14]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/73.png

Flora in Columbia, South Carolina",DePaul,2011,2015,5,true,,"""[2, 2]""",/coaches/corbity01c.html,"Tyrone Kennedy Corbin (born December 31, 1962) is an American retired basketball player, and current assistant coach of the Orlando Magic in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was first appointed the assistant coach of the Phoenix Suns, then was named the Utah Jazz’s head coach, on February 10, 2011 following the resignation of longtime coach Jerry Sloan.[1] He was also the brief interim head coach of the Sacramento Kings in the 2014-15 season before being replaced by George Karl. Prior to that, Corbin played 16 seasons in the NBA. Corbin played collegiately at DePaul University from 1981 to 1985. He played in 120 games for the Blue Demons, increasing his scoring average and field goal and free throw percentage in each of his four seasons.[2] Corbin posted averages of 11.5 points (on .504 FG and .764 FT), 7.4 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 1.1 steal and 2.3 turnovers in 31.1 minutes per game.[3] He finished seventh on DePaul's career scoring list and was a two-time honorable mention AP All-America selection, as well as an All-NIT choice in 1983, and he was invited to the 1984 Olympic trials. He graduated with a degree in computer science, before becoming a second-round pick of the San Antonio Spurs in the 1985 NBA Draft. He was a team captain in his junior and senior years; the former was Ray Meyer's last as head coach, the latter was Joey Meyer's first.[4] He was inducted into the DePaul University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005.[5] Corbin played in the NBA at small forward from 1985 to 2000. His first two seasons were with the San Antonio Spurs, as he was their selection in the second round (35th pick overall) of the 1985 NBA Draft. After signing with the Cleveland Cavaliers in January 1987, he was part of the trade by the Cavs which sent Kevin Johnson, Mark West, 1988 first-round and second-round draft picks and a 1989 second-round draft pick to the Phoenix Suns for Larry Nance, Mike Sanders and a 1988 first-round draft choice in February 1988. After being selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the expansion draft in 1989, he led the team and established career-highs in 1989-90 in rebounds (7.4) and steals (2.13). Corbin also recorded the first triple-double in Timberwolves history, with 10 points, 13 rebounds and a career-high 10 assists, against the Dallas Mavericks on January 2, 1991. His stint with the Jazz came by a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves for Thurl Bailey early in the 1991-92 season, enabling him to help the team reach the NBA Western Conference Finals twice.[6] He averaged 9.6 points and 6.2 rebounds in 233 games for the Jazz from 1991 to 1994.[2] He was then traded by the Jazz with a 1995 second-round draft pick to the Atlanta Hawks for Adam Keefe in September 1994. It was in Atlanta where his streak of 415 consecutive games played would be broken. Corbin then was traded to the Sacramento Kings for Spud Webb in June 1995. Along with Walt Williams, he went to the Miami Heat for Billy Owens and Kevin Gamble in February 1996. He then spent three seasons with the Hawks via free-agent signing in 1996. After returning to the Kings as a free agent in 1999, he spent the next season with the Toronto Raptors. He was traded by Toronto with Corliss Williamson, Kornel David and a first-round draft pick to the Detroit Pistons for Jerome Williams and Eric Montross in February 2001.[7] Wearing No. 23 and No. 33 throughout his playing career,[6] he averaged 9.3 points (on .457 percent from the field), 4.8 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.2 steals in nearly 26 minutes per game while playing 1,065 games in his career.[3] A versatile small forward, Corbin also played in 81 NBA playoff games in his career, including 37 with the Jazz, averaging 8.4 points and 5.0 rebounds per game. After his playing career, Corbin spent one season with the Charleston Lowgators of the NBDL as a player mentor. Corbin was hired by Scott Layden, then general manager of the New York Knicks, as manager of Knicks player development for the 2003-04 season. In 2004, he went to the Utah Jazz, spending seven years as an assistant coach under Jerry Sloan before eventually succeeding Sloan as head coach in 2011.[6] On April 21, 2014, the Jazz announced that they had elected not to offer Corbin a new contract.[8] Afterwards he became an assistant coach of the Sacramento Kings and on December 15, 2014 he was promoted to interim head coach after Mike Malone was fired.[9] On February 12, 2015, he was relieved of his head coaching duties by the Kings, choosing to continue working with the organization as an advisor to the front office.[10] On June 25, 2016, two days after the 2016 NBA Draft ended, the Phoenix Suns announced that Corbin would return to the Phoenix Suns as an assistant coach under Earl Watson's newest coaching staff. Watson was a previous player under Corbin's tenure during his last season coaching the Jazz, and was also a mentor for Watson as he began his transition into coaching in the NBA.[11] He'd also be reunited later on with Mehmet Okur, another former player he coached that'd join the Suns' coaching staff as a player development coach. After a 2 season stint in Phoenix, Corbin and the Suns parted ways. Corbin has two children, Tyjha, and Tyrell with his wife, high school sweetheart, Dante.[6] Tyrell was one of the top basketball prospects from Utah, playing point guard for West High. He was named Utah's Mr. Basketball in the year 2011. [12] He went on to play for the UC Davis Aggies men's basketball team, a Division I school competing in the Big West Conference[13] and coached by Jim Les, his father's Atlanta Hawks teammate from the 1994–95 NBA season.[14][15] Tyrell currently plays for the Northern Arizona Suns.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/74.png

He was known as the National Basketball Association's last two-handed set shooter. After playing at Niagara University, he joined the Philadelphia Warriors in 1954. Two years later he was traded to the Syracuse Nationals. He retired in 1965 from the Philadelphia 76ers (the former Syracuse Nationals), but eventually came back for the 1966–67 NBA season after new head coach Alex Hannum told him he needed a veteran point guard. With 42 games into the season, Costello ripped his Achilles tendon on January 6, 1967 and was replaced by Wali Jones. He did, however, come back to participate in the 1967 playoffs. Costello ended his career for the second and final time in 1968. During his NBA career, Costello was selected to six NBA All-Star Games (playing in five). He led the league in free throw percentage in the 1962–63 and 1964–65 seasons. Costello began his coaching career at East Syracuse-Minoa High School where he coached the boys varsity basketball team to the state championship for the first time in school history. He took over as head coach of the expansion team Milwaukee Bucks in 1968 and coached them to a league-best 66–16 mark in 1970–71 including a then-NBA record 20-game win streak. They won the championship in the post-season with a 4-0 sweep of the Baltimore Bullets. After a 3–15 start in the 1976–77 season, Costello resigned on November 22, 1976.[1] He was replaced by Don Nelson, who would be Head Coach of the Bucks for 11 seasons. He coached the Chicago Bulls for 56 games in 1978–79 before returning to Milwaukee to coach the Milwaukee Does of the Women's Professional Basketball League for part of the 1979–80 season. Costello's last coaching job was at Utica College in the 1980s. The school was making the transition from Division III to Division I as an independent. Costello coached one season in Division III. In his second year in Division I, the Pioneers were the seventh most improved team in the country based on their won-loss record. He retired in 1987. Costello appeared on NBA Live videogame series, as member of the 1950s NBA Live Legend All-Stars Team. Costello died on December 13, 2001 after battling cancer for more than a year.[2] Costello was featured in the book Basketball History in Syracuse, Hoops Roots by author Mark Allen Baker published by The History Press in 2010. The book is an introduction to professional basketball in Syracuse and includes teams like (Vic Hanson's) All-Americans, the Syracuse Reds and the Syracuse Nationals (1946–1963).",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/75.png
76,Bob Cousy,"August 9, 1928",,"Andrew Jackson in Cambria Heights, New York",Holy Cross,1970,1974,5,true,,"""[2]""",/coaches/cousybo01c.html,"Robert Joseph Cousy (/ˈkuːziː/, born August 9, 1928) is an American retired professional basketball player. Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963, and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 1969–70 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament, and won NCAA All-American honors for three seasons. Cousy was initially drafted by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks as the third overall pick in the first round of the 1950 NBA draft, but after he refused to report, he was picked up by Boston. He had an exceptionally successful career with the Celtics, leading the league an unprecedented 8 straight years in assists, playing on six NBA championship teams, and being voted into 13 NBA All-Star Games in his 13 full NBA seasons. He was also named to 12 All-NBA First and Second Teams and won the 1957 NBA Most Valuable Player Award.[1] En route to his assist streak that was unmatched either in number of crowns or consecutive years, Cousy introduced a new blend of ball-handling and passing skills to the NBA that earned him the nickname ""The Houdini of the Hardwood"".[2] Also known as ""Cooz"", he was regularly introduced at Boston Garden as ""Mr. Basketball"". After his playing career, he coached the Royals for several years, capped by a seven-game cameo comeback for them at age 41. Cousy then became a broadcaster for Celtics games. Upon his election to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 the Celtics retired his No. 14 jersey and hung it in the rafters of the Garden.[2] Cousy was named to the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971, the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1981, and the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996, making him one of only four players that were selected to each of those teams. He was also the first president of National Basketball Players Association. On August 22, 2019, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald Trump. [3] Cousy was the only son of poor French immigrants living in New York City. He grew up in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan's East Side, in the midst of the Great Depression.[4] His father Joseph was a cab driver, who earned extra income by moonlighting. The elder Cousy had served in the German Army during World War I. Shortly after the war, his first wife died of pneumonia, leaving behind a young daughter. He married Julie Corlet, a secretary and French teacher from Dijon.[5] At the time of the 1930 census, the family was renting an apartment in Astoria, Queens, for $50 per month. The younger Cousy spoke French for the first 5 years of his life, and started to speak English only after entering primary school. He spent his early days playing stickball in a multicultural environment, regularly playing with African Americans, Jews and other ethnic minority children.[5] These experiences ingrained him with a strong anti-racist sentiment, an attitude he prominently promoted during his professional career.[6] When he was 12, his family moved to a rented house in St. Albans, Queens. That summer, the elder Cousy put a $500 down payment for a $4,500 house four blocks away. He rented out the bottom two floors of the three-story building to tenants to help make his mortgage payments on time.[7] Cousy took up basketball at the age of 13 as a student at St. Pascal's elementary school, and was ""immediately hooked"".[8] The following year, he entered Andrew Jackson High School in St Albans. His basketball success was not immediate, and in fact he was cut from the school team in his first year. Later that year, he joined the St. Albans Lindens of the Press League, a basketball league sponsored by the Long Island Press,[9] where he began to develop his basketball skills and gained much-needed experience. The next year, however, he was again cut during the tryouts for the school basketball team. That same year, he fell out of a tree and broke his right hand. The injury forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, making him effectively ambidextrous. In retrospect, he described this accident as ""a fortunate event"" and cited it as a factor in making him more versatile on the court.[10] During a Press League game, the high school basketball coach saw him play. He was impressed by the budding star's two-handed ability and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team. He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad.[11] He continued to practice day and night, and by his junior year was sure he was going to be promoted to the varsity; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester.[12] He joined the varsity squad midway through the season, however, scoring 28 points in his first game.[13] He had no intention of attending college, but after he started to make a name for himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it easier for him to get into college.[14] He again excelled in basketball his senior year, leading his team to the Queens divisional championship and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player. He was even named captain of the Journal-American All-Scholastic team.[15] He then began to plan for college. His family had wanted him to attend a Catholic school, and he wanted to go somewhere outside New York City. Boston College recruited him, and he considered accepting the BC offer, but it had no dormitories, and he was not interested in being a commuter student. Soon afterward, he received an offer from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts about forty miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. He was impressed by the school, and accepted the basketball scholarship it offered him.[16] He spent the summer before matriculating working at Tamarack Lodge in the Catskill Mountains and playing in a local basketball league along with a number of established college players.[17] Cousy was one of six freshmen on the Holy Cross Crusaders' varsity basketball team in 1946–47. From the start of the season, coach Doggie Julian chose to play the six freshmen off the bench in a two-team system, so that each player would get some time on the court. As members of the ""second team"", they would come off the bench nine and a half minutes into the game, where they would relieve the ""first team"" starters. They would sometimes get to play as much as a third or even half of the game,[18] but even at that Cousy was so disappointed with the lack of playing time that he went to the campus chapel after practice to pray that Julian would give him more of a chance to show off his talents on the court.[18] Early in the season, however, he got into trouble with Julian, who accused him of being a showboater. Even as late as that 1946–47 season basketball was a static game, depending on slow, deliberate player movement and flat-footed shots. Far different was Cousy's up-tempo, streetball-like game, marked by ambidextrous finesse play and notable for behind-the-back dribbling and no-look, behind-the-back and half-court passing.[2] Even so, he had enough playing time in games to score 227 points for the season, finishing with the third-highest total on the team. Led by stars George Kaftan and Joe Mullaney, the Crusaders finished the 1946–47 basketball season 24–3.[19] On the basis of that record, Holy Cross got into the 1947 NCAA Tournament as the last seed in the then only eight-team tournament. In the first game, they defeated Navy 55-47 in front of a sell-out crowd at Madison Square Garden. Mullaney led the team in scoring with 18 points, thanks to Navy coach Ben Carnevale's decision to have his players back off from Mullaney, who was reputed as being more of a playmaker than a shooter.[20] In the semifinal game, the Crusaders faced CCNY, coached by Nat Holman, one of the game's earliest innovators. Led by Kaftan's thirty points, Holy Cross easily defeated the Beavers 60–45.[21] In the championship game, the Crusaders faced Oklahoma, coached by Bruce Drake, in another sold-out game at Madison Square Garden. Kaftan followed up his 30-point semifinal heroics with a mere 18 points in the title game, which was far more than enough for the team to defeat the Sooners 58–47.[21] Cousy played poorly, however, scoring only four points on 2-for-13 shots. Holy Cross became the first New England college to win the NCAA tournament. On their arrival back in Worcester, the team was given a hero's welcome by about ten thousand cheering fans who met their train at Union Station.[21] The following season Julian limited Cousy's playing time, to the point that the frustrated sophomore contemplated transferring out of Holy Cross. Cousy wrote a letter to coach Joe Lapchick of St. John's University in New York, informing him that he was considering a transfer there. Lapchick wrote back to Cousy that he considered Julian ""one of the finest basketball coaches in America""[22] and that he believed Julian had no bad intentions in restricting his playing time. He told Cousy that Julian would use him more often during his later years with the team. Lapchick alerted Cousy that transferring was a very risky move: according to NCAA rules, the player would be required to sit out a year before becoming eligible to play for the school to which he transferred.[23] During Cousy's senior year of 1949–1950, his fate changed in a match against Loyola of Chicago at Boston Garden. With 5 minutes left and Holy Cross trailing, the crowd started to chant ""We want Cousy!"" until coach Julian relented.[24] In these few minutes, Cousy scored 11 points and hit a game-winning buzzer-beater coming off a behind-the-back dribble. The performance established him as a team leader, and he then led Holy Cross to 26 straight wins and a Number 4 national ranking. A three-time All-American,[2] Cousy ended his college career in the 1950 NCAA Tournament, when Holy Cross fell to North Carolina State in an opening round game at Madison Square Garden. CCNY would go on to win the tournament. Cousy turned pro and made himself available for the 1950 NBA draft. The Boston Celtics had just concluded the 1949–50 NBA season with a poor 22–46 win-loss record and had the first draft pick. It was strongly anticipated that they would draft the highly coveted local favorite Cousy. However, coach Red Auerbach snubbed him for center Charlie Share, saying: ""Am I supposed to win, or please the local yokels?"" The local press strongly criticized Auerbach,[2] but other scouts were also skeptical about Cousy, viewing him as flamboyant but ineffective. One scout wrote in his report: ""The first time he tries that fancy Dan stuff in this league, they'll cram the ball down his throat.""[8] As a result, the Tri-Cities Blackhawks drafted Cousy, but the point guard was unenthusiastic about his new employer. Cousy was trying to establish a driving school in Worcester, Massachusetts and did not want to relocate to the Midwestern triangle of the three small towns of Moline, Rock Island and Davenport. As compensation for having to give up his driving school, Cousy demanded a salary of $10,000 from Blackhawks owner Ben Kerner. When Kerner only offered him $6,000, Cousy refused to report.[10] Cousy was then picked up by the Chicago Stags, but when they folded, league Commissioner Maurice Podoloff declared three Stags available for a dispersal draft: team scoring leader Max Zaslofsky, Andy Phillip and Cousy.[10] Celtics owner Walter A. Brown was one of the three club bosses invited. He later made it clear that he was hoping for Zaslofsky, would have tolerated Phillip, and did not want Cousy. When the Celtics drew Cousy, Brown confessed: ""I could have fallen to the floor."" Brown reluctantly gave him a $9,000 salary.[2] It was not long before both Auerbach and Brown changed their minds. With averages of 15.6 points, 6.9 rebounds and 4.9 assists a game, Cousy received the first of his 13 consecutive NBA All-Star selections[1] and led a Celtics team with future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famers Ed Macauley and Bones McKinney to a 39–30 record in the 1950–51 NBA season. However, in the 1951 NBA Playoffs, the Celtics were beaten by the New York Knicks.[25] With future Hall-of-Fame guard Bill Sharman on board the next season, Cousy averaged 21.7 points, 6.4 rebounds and 6.7 assists per game en route to his first All-NBA First Team nomination.[1] Nonetheless, the Celtics lost to the Knicks in the 1952 NBA Playoffs.[26] In the following season, Cousy made further progress. Averaging 7.7 assists per game, he won the first of his eight consecutive assists titles.[1] These numbers were made despite the fact that the NBA had not yet introduced the shot clock, making the game static and putting prolific assist givers at a disadvantage.[2] Powered by Auerbach's quick fastbreak-dominated tactics, the Celtics won 46 games and beat the Syracuse Nationals 2–0 in the 1953 NBA Playoffs. Game 2 ended 111–105 in a 4-overtime thriller, in which Cousy had a much-lauded game. Despite having an injured leg, he scored 25 points after four quarters, scored 6 of his team's 9 points in the first overtime, hit a clutch free throw in the last seconds, and scored all 4 of Boston's points in the second overtime. He scored 8 more points in the third overtime, among them a 25-ft. buzzer beater. In the fourth overtime, he scored 9 of Boston's 12 points. Cousy played 66 minutes, and scored 50 points after making a still-standing record of 30 free throws in 32 attempts. This game is regarded by the NBA as one of the finest scoring feats ever, in line with Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game.[2] However, for the third time in a row, the Knicks beat Boston in the next round.[27] In the next three years, Cousy firmly established himself as one of the league's best point guards. Leading the league in assists all 3 seasons, and averaging 20 points and 7 rebounds, the versatile Cousy earned himself three more All-NBA First Team and All-Star honors, and was also Most Valuable Player of the 1954 NBA All-Star Game.[1] In terms of playing style, Cousy introduced an array of visually attractive street basketball moves, described by the NBA as a mix of ambidextrous, behind-the-back dribbling and ""no-look passes, behind-the-back feeds or half-court fastbreak launches"".[2] Cousy's modus operandi contrasted with the rest of the NBA, which was dominated by muscular low post scorers and deliberate set shooters.[10] Soon, he was called ""Houdini of the Hardwood"" after the magician Harry Houdini. Cousy's crowd-pleasing and effective play drew the crowd into the Boston Garden and also won over coach Auerbach, who no longer saw him as a liability, but as an essential building block for the future.[28] The Celtics eventually added two talented forwards, future Hall-of-Famer Frank Ramsey and defensive specialist Jim Loscutoff. Along with Celtics colleague Bob Brannum, Loscutoff also became Cousy's unofficial bodyguard, retaliating against opposing players who would try to hurt him.[29] The Celtics were unable to make their mark in the 1954 NBA Playoffs, 1955 NBA Playoffs, and 1956 NBA Playoffs, where they lost three times in a row against the Nationals.[30][31][32] Cousy attributed the shortcomings to fatigue, stating: ""We would get tired in the end and could not get the ball"".[33] As a result, Auerbach sought a defensive center who could get easy rebounds, initiate fast breaks and close out games.[28] Before the 1956–57 NBA season, Auerbach drafted two future Hall-of-Famers: forward Tom Heinsohn, and defensive center Bill Russell. Powered by these new players, the Celtics went 44–28 in the regular season,[2] and Cousy averaged 20.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and a league-leading 7.5 assists, earning his first NBA Most Valuable Player Award; he also won his second NBA All-Star Game MVP award.[1] The Celtics reached the 1957 NBA Finals, and powered by Cousy on offense and rugged center Russell on defense, they beat the Hawks 4–3, who were noted for future Hall-of-Fame power forward Bob Pettit and former teammates Macauley and Hagan. Cousy finally won his first title.[34] In the 1957–58 NBA season, Cousy had yet another highly productive year, with his 20.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and 8.6 assists per game leading to nominations into the All-NBA First Team and the All-Star team. He again led the NBA in assists.[1] The Celtics reached the 1958 NBA Finals against the Hawks, but when Russell succumbed to a foot injury in Game 3, the Celtics faded and bowed out four games to two. This was the last losing NBA playoff series in which Cousy would play.[35] In the following 1958–59 NBA season, the Celtics got revenge on their opposition, powered by an inspired Cousy, who averaged 20.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and a league-high 8.6 assists a game, won another assists title and another pair of All-NBA First Team and All-Star team nominations.[1] Late in the season, Cousy reasserted his playmaking dominance by setting an NBA record with 28 assists in a game against the Minneapolis Lakers. While that record was broken 19 years later, Cousy also set a record for 19 assists in a half which has never been broken. The Celtics stormed through the playoffs and, behind Cousy's 51 total assists (still a record for a four-game NBA Finals series), defeated the Minneapolis Lakers in the first 4–0 sweep ever in the 1959 NBA Finals.[36] In the 1959–60 NBA season, Cousy was again productive, his 19.4 points, 4.7 rebounds and 9.5 assists per game earning him his eighth consecutive assists title and another joint All-NBA First Team and All-Star team nomination.[1] Again, the Celtics defeated all opposition and won the 1960 NBA Finals 4–3 against the Hawks.[37] A year later, the 32-year-old Cousy scored 18.1 points, 4.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists per game, winning another pair of All-NBA First Team and All-Star nominations, but failing to win the assists crown after eight consecutive seasons.[1] However, the Celtics won the 1961 NBA Finals after convincingly beating the Hawks 4–1.[38] In the 1961–62 NBA season, the aging Cousy slowly began to fade statistically, averaging 15.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 7.8 assists, and was voted into the All-NBA Second Team after ten consecutive First Team nominations.[1] Still, he enjoyed a satisfying postseason, winning the 1962 NBA Finals after 4–3 battles against two upcoming teams, the Philadelphia Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers. The Finals series against the Lakers was especially dramatic, because Lakers guard Frank Selvy failed to make a last-second buzzer beater in Game 7 which would have won the title.[39] Finally, in the 1962–63 NBA season, the last of his career, Cousy averaged 13.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists, and collected one last All-Star and All-NBA Second Team nomination.[1] In the 1963 NBA Finals, the Celtics again won 4–2 against the Lakers, and Cousy finished his career on a high note: in the fourth quarter of Game 6, Cousy sprained an ankle and had to be helped to the bench. He went back in with Boston up 1. Although he did not score again, he was credited with providing an emotional lift that carried the Celtics to victory, 112–109. The game ended with Cousy throwing the ball into the rafters.[2] At age 34, Cousy held his retirement ceremony on March 17, 1963 in a packed Boston Garden. The event became known as the Boston Tear Party, when the crowd's response overwhelmed Cousy, left him speechless, and caused his planned 7-minute farewell to go on for 20. Joe Dillon, a water worker from South Boston, Massachusetts, and a devoted Celtics fan, screamed ""We love ya, Cooz"", breaking the tension and the crowd went into cheers.[2] As a testament to Cousy's legacy, President John F. Kennedy wired to Cousy: ""The game bears an indelible stamp of your rare skills and competitive daring."" After retiring as a player, Cousy published his autobiography Basketball Is My Life in 1963, and in the same year became coach at Boston College. In the 1965 ECAC Holiday Basketball Festival at Madison Square Garden, Providence defeated Boston College 91-86 in the title game, when the Friars were led by Tourney MVP and All-American Jimmy Walker. Providence was coached by Joe Mullaney, who was Cousy's teammate at Holy Cross when the two men were players there in 1947. In his six seasons there, he had a record of 117 wins and 38 losses and was named New England Coach of the Year for 1968 and 1969. Cousy led the Eagles to three NIT appearances, including a berth in the 1969 NIT Championship and two National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments, including the 1967 Eastern Regional Finals.[2] Cousy grew bored with college basketball and returned to the NBA as coach of the Cincinnati Royals, team of fellow Hall-of-Fame point guard Oscar Robertson. He later said about this engagement, ""I did it for the money. I was made an offer I couldn't refuse.""[8] In 1970, the 41-year-old Cousy even made a late-season comeback as a player to boost ticket sales. Despite his meager output of 5 points in 34 minutes of playing time in seven games,[1] ticket sales jumped by 77 percent.[2] He continued as coach of the team after it moved from Cincinnati to Kansas City/Omaha, but stepped down as the Kings' coach early in the 1973–74 NBA season with a 141–209 record.[2] Despite his unfamiliarity with the sport, Cousy was appointed Commissioner of the American Soccer League on December 19, 1974.[40] His most notable act as commissioner was to declare the New York Apollo and Boston Astros co‐champions after both teams played 67 minutes of overtime without resolution in the second and deciding leg of the league's championship series on September 20, 1975.[41] He was relieved of his duties on December 1, 1979. Pennsylvania Stoners club owner Willie Ehrlich explained the dismissal by stating, ""After five years as commissioner, Cousy still goes around telling people he knows nothing about soccer.""[42] He was a color analyst on Celtics telecasts during the 1980s.""[8] In addition, Cousy had a role in the basketball film Blue Chips in 1993, in which he played a college athletic director. Today he is a marketing consultant for the Celtics, and occasionally makes broadcast appearances with Mike Gorman and ex-Celtic teammate Tom Heinsohn.[43] In 1954, the NBA had no health benefits, pension plan, minimum salary, and the average player's salary was $8,000 a season. To combat this, Cousy organized the National Basketball Players Association, the first trade union among those in the four major North American professional sports leagues. Cousy served as its first president until 1958. In his 13-year, 924-game NBA playing career, Cousy finished with 16,960 points, 4,786 rebounds and 6,955 assists, translating to averages of 18.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 7.5 assists per game.[1] He was regarded as the first great point guard of the NBA, winning eight of the first 11 assist titles in the league, all of them en bloc, and had a highly successful career, winning six NBA titles, one MVP award, 13 All-Star and 12 All-NBA First and Second Team call-ups and two All-Star MVP awards.[1] With his eye-catching dribbling and unorthodox passing, Cousy popularized modern guard play and raised the profile of the Boston Celtics and the entire NBA.[8] His fast-paced playing style was later emulated by the likes of Pete Maravich and Magic Johnson.[2] In recognition of his feats, Cousy was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 and honored by the Celtics, who retired his uniform number, 14. Celtics owner Walter Brown said: ""The Celtics wouldn't be here without him [Cousy]. He made basketball in this town. If he had played in New York he would have been the biggest thing since [New York Yankees baseball legend] Babe Ruth. I think he is anyway.""[8] In addition, on May 11, 2006, ESPN.com rated Cousy as the fifth-greatest point guard of all time, lauding him as ""ahead of his time with his ballhandling and passing skills"" and pointing out he is one of only seven point guards ever to win a NBA Most Valuable Player award.[46] On November 16, 2008, Cousy's college uniform number, 17, was hoisted to the Hart Center rafters. During halftime of a game between the Holy Cross Crusaders and St. Joseph's Hawks, the uniform numbers of Cousy, George Kaftan, Togo Palazzi, and Tommy Heinsohn became the first to hang from the gymnasium's ceiling. On July 1, 2019, Cousy advised The Boston Globe that he had received an official letter notifying him that he would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump on August 22, 2019.[47] He received the medal at a ceremony in the Oval Office.[48] Cousy married his college sweetheart, Missie Ritterbusch, in December 1950, six months after he graduated from Holy Cross.[49] They lived in Worcester, Massachusetts,[43] and had two daughters. His wife died on September 20, 2013, after suffering from dementia for several years.[50] Cousy was well-known, both on and off the court, for his public stance against racism, a result of his upbringing in a multicultural environment. In 1950, the Celtics played a game in the then-segregated city of Charlotte, North Carolina, and teammate Chuck Cooper—the first African-American in NBA history to be drafted—would have been denied a hotel room. Instead of taking the hotel room, Cousy insisted on travelling with Cooper on an uncomfortable overnight train. He described their visit to a segregated men's toilet—Cooper was prohibited from using the clean ""for whites"" bathroom and had to use the shabby ""for colored"" facility—as one of the most shameful experiences of his life.[51] He also sympathized with the plight of black Celtics star Bill Russell, who was frequently a victim of racism.[52] Cousy was close to his Celtics mentor, head coach Red Auerbach, and was one of the few permitted to call him ""Arnold"", his given name, instead of his nickname ""Red"".[10]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/76.png
77,Dave Cowens,"October 25, 1948",,"Central Catholic in Newport, Kentucky",Florida State,1979,2002,6,true,,"""[2, 4, 1]""",/coaches/cowenda01c.html,"David William Cowens (born October 25, 1948)[1] is an American retired professional basketball player and NBA head coach. At 6'9"",[2] he played the center position and occasionally played power forward. Cowens spent most of his playing career with the Boston Celtics. He was the 1971 NBA Rookie of the Year and the 1973 NBA Most Valuable Player. Cowens won NBA championships as a member of the Celtics in 1974 and 1976. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1991. Cowens has held numerous NBA head coaching positions. Most recently, Cowens served as an assistant coach and then as a special assistant to Detroit Pistons President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars.[3] After starring in high school at Newport Catholic High in his hometown of Newport, Kentucky, Cowens played his collegiate basketball at Florida State University from 1967 to 1970. He scored 1,479 points in 78 games at Florida State, at 19.0 points per game, and ranks among Florida State's top 10 all-time scoring leaders. He is the all-time Florida State leading rebounder with 1,340 rebounds (17.2 rebounds per game). He holds the team record for best seasonal rebound average (17.5 in the 1968–1969 season). He once grabbed 31 rebounds (second best all-time) against LSU in the 1968–69 season. He was named The Sporting News All-America second team in 1970. His number now hangs in the rafters of the Donald L. Tucker Center. Despite some critics who felt Cowens was too small to play center, Cowens was selected as the fourth overall pick by the Boston Celtics during the 1970 NBA draft, largely at the recommendation of former Celtics center Bill Russell.[1] ""No one is going to tell that kid he can't play center,"" Russell said of Cowens.[4] During his rookie year, Cowens averaged 17.0 points per game and 15.0 rebounds per game. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team and shared the NBA's Rookie of the Year honors with Portland's Geoff Petrie. He also led the league in personal fouls that same year. In 1973, Cowens averaged 20.5 ppg, 16.2 rpg and 4.1 apg while helping the Celtics to a league-best 68–14 record. In that season also, Cowens scored 20 points, grabbed a career-high 32 rebounds and dished out 9 assists in a home win over the Houston Rockets. He carried the Celtics to the semifinals, where they met the New York Knicks. They won Game 1 of that best-of-7 series after Cowens recorded 15 points and 18 rebounds. However, they bowed out to the Knicks in Game 7.[5] He was chosen the NBA MVP as well as MVP of the All-Star Game that same season. Cowens and fellow Celtic Bill Russell both have the distinction of being named MVP of the league but not being included on the All-NBA First Team. The next season, Cowens averaged 19.0 PPG, 15.7 RPG, 4.4 APG and 1.3 BPG while guiding the Celtics to a record of 56-26. Cowens was instrumental in bringing the Celtics into the playoffs, where they defeated the Buffalo Braves in six games and the New York Knicks in five. In the finals, the Celtics faced the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks. The teams split the first six games, with each team winning at least once on their home court. This led to a decisive Game 7, where the Celtics faced the Bucks in Milwaukee. The Celtics prevailed thanks to a strong performance by Dave Cowens, who recorded 28 points and 14 rebounds as the Celtics took their 12th NBA championship. John Havlicek was named the NBA Finals MVP. As a testament to his all-around ability, Cowens is one of only five players (Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, LeBron James, and Giannis Antetokounmpo are the others) to lead his team in all five major statistical categories for a season: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals. He accomplished the feat in the 1977–78 season, averaging 18.6 points, 14.0 rebounds, 4.6 assists, 0.9 blocks and 1.3 steals as Boston finished 32-50.[6] In his final Boston season, 1979–80, Cowens helped the Celtics improve to 61–21, after finishing 29–53 the season before. Cowens had served as player-coach for the remainder of the 1978–79 season (27–41) after Satch Sanders (2–12) was fired after a poor start.[7] Alongside rookie Larry Bird in 1979-1980, Cowens averaged 14.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 3.1 assists under coach Bill Fitch. Along with Bird, Tiny Archibald, Cedric Maxwell, Pete Maravich, Chris Ford, M.L. Carr and Rick Robey, Cowens and the Celtics defeated the Houston Rockets 4-0 in the Eastern Conference playoffs, before losing to the Philadelphia 76ers with Julius Erving 4–1 in the Eastern Conference finals. Cowens averaged 40 minutes, 13.2 points and 8.8 rebounds in the 76ers series.[8][9] Cowens retired as a player in 1980, as Boston drafted Kevin McHale and traded for Robert Parish to replace him at center. Boston then won the 1981 NBA Championship.[10] ""I have sprained my ankle at least 30 times over the duration of my career, broken both legs and fractured a foot,"" Cowens said upon retiring. ""Two years ago, a team of foot and bone specialists said they were amazed that I could play up to that point without sustaining serious injuries.""[4] However, in 1982–83, Cowens felt the itch to play again and talked to the Celtics about trading him, as they still held his rights. ""I think that would be best,"" he said of a trade. ""The Celtics are set up front (with Bird, McHale and Parish). They could trade me, work something out. No disrespect to Bill Fitch. I'd advise any younger players to play for him, but I'd probably be better off somewhere else.""[4] After first negotiating with the Phoenix Suns, the Celtics traded Cowens to the Milwaukee Bucks, coached by former Celtic teammate Don Nelson. The Celtics received Quinn Buckner from Milwaukee as compensation.[4] Cowens averaged 8.1 points, 6.9 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 25 minutes per game with the Bucks, playing alongside Bob Lanier, Marques Johnson, Sidney Moncrief and Junior Bridgeman. The Bucks finished 51-31 and defeated Cowens' old team, the Boston Celtics, 4–0 in the Eastern Conference playoffs. The Bucks lost 4–1 to the eventual NBA Champion Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern conference finals. But, Cowens had been injured in the final game of the regular season, and was unable to play in the playoffs for Milwaukee.[11][4] Cowens had played 40 total games for the Bucks during the 1982–83 season, before retiring for good.[12] During his NBA career, Cowens averaged a double-double of 17.6 points and 13.6 rebounds. with 3.8 assists and 1.1 steals in 766 career NBA games. Cowens was selected to eight All-Star Games, was named to the All-NBA Second Team three times, and was named to the All-NBA Defensive First Team in 1976 and All-NBA Defensive Second Team in 1973 and 1980. He was a member of the Celtics' 1974 and 1976 NBA Championship teams.[12] Cowens' playing credo was all-out intensity at both ends of the court, a style that never wavered during his 11-year NBA career. ""He was quick, fast, strong and skilled, and played hard,"" Knicks Hall of Fame center Willis Reed said of Cowens.[4] ""No one ever did more for the Celtics than Dave did,"" said John Havlicek of his Celtic teammate.[4] He began his coaching career by serving as a player-coach for the Boston Celtics during the 1978–79 season, but he quit coaching after the season and returned as a full-time player before retiring in 1980.[13] Cowens coached the Bay State Bombardiers of the Continental Basketball Association in 1984–85. Cowens returned to NBA coaching ranks, as an assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs in 1994–96 and was considered for the coaching job of the Boston Celtics during the 1995 off-season.[14] Cowens was head coach of the Charlotte Hornets from 1996 to 1999. He was head coach with the Golden State Warriors from 1999 to 2001, a tenure of 105 games. In 2005–06 Cowens was head coach of the Chicago Sky of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). Cowens was an assistant coach of the Detroit Pistons from 2006 to 2009. Cowens became the fourth center to average 5 assists in a single season, joining Wilt Chamberlain, former Celtic center, Bill Russell, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. His career average is 3.8 assists per game.[citation needed] As of the end of the 2018-19 season, Cowens ranked 27th overall for most point-rebound-assist triple-doubles by a center in NBA history.[citation needed] As evidence to his all-around ability, Cowens is one of only five players (Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, LeBron James, and Giannis Antetokounmpo are the others) to lead his team in all five major statistical categories for a season: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals. He did that in 1977-78 season.[citation needed] In 1990, Cowens, a former Democrat, ran as a Republican for Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth. However, because he did not register by June 5, 1989, he was unable to appear on the primary ballot.[15][16] Cowens considered running a sticker campaign for the Republican nomination, however he decided to drop out of the race.[16]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/77.png

He spent a total of 17 seasons with the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers (nine as player, eight as coach), and two seasons as a player with the Carolina Cougars of the ABA. Billy Cunningham was born in Brooklyn, New York. His fame began while he was playing at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn,[1] where he was the MVP in the Brooklyn League in 1961. That year, he was the First-Team All-New York City, and a member of the Parade Magazine All-America Team. Cunningham then went to the University of North Carolina, where he excelled. He once grabbed a record 27 rebounds in a game vs. Clemson on February 16, 1963. Cunningham also set a single-game North Carolina record with 48 points against Tulane on December 10, 1964. In his UNC career, he scored 1,709 points (24.8 points per game), and grabbed 1,062 rebounds (15.4 rebounds per game). Upon graduation, his 1,062 rebounds were the best in North Carolina history and he held seasonal records for most rebounds (379 in 1964) and rebound average (16.1 in 1963). In 1965, Cunningham joined the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association as a sixth man and played well enough to be named to the NBA All-Rookie Team. Cunningham was a member of the powerful 1967 Sixers championship team (featuring Wilt Chamberlain, Hal Greer, Chet Walker, and Luke Jackson). After Chamberlain left the team in 1968, Cunningham became the 76ers' franchise player. He would replace the injured and aging Luke Jackson as the starting power forward of the team, and averaged 24.8 points per game and 12.8 rebounds per game during the 1968–69 season while leading the 76ers to 55 wins. After that season, he earned the first of what would be three straight All-NBA First Team selections. In 1972, he joined the Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association. In his first ABA season, Cunningham averaged 24.1 points per game, 12.0 rebounds per game, and led the league in total steals. He led the Cougars to the best record in the league and was selected to the All-ABA First Team and was named the ABA MVP. During the post-season, the Cougars defeated the New York Nets in five games in the Eastern Division Semifinals to advance to the Eastern Division Finals. In the Division Finals the Cougars lost a tight seven game series to the Kentucky Colonels, 4 games to 3. In the 1973–74 season Cunningham and the Cougars finished third in the Eastern Division and lost again to the Kentucky Colonels in the Eastern Division semifinals. After the 1973–74 season, Cunningham returned to the 76ers, where he played until he suffered a career-ending injury early in the 1975–76 season. For his career, Cunningham scored 16,310 points and grabbed 7,981 rebounds in both the NBA and the ABA. After his playing days were done, he became the head coach of the 76ers on November 4, 1977, featuring the likes of Bobby Jones, Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, Moses Malone, and Julius Erving. He reached the 300, and 400-win milestone faster than any coach in NBA history. He led Philadelphia to the playoffs in every year as coach, and advanced to the NBA Finals 3 times, in the 1979–80, 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons. The 76ers lost to the Lakers in 1980 and 1982, but after acquiring Moses Malone, they finally got past the Lakers in 1983, winning the franchise's third (and most recent) NBA Championship as part of a 12-1 playoff run. Upon his retirement, his 454 wins as a head coach were the 12th best in NBA history. He holds the third best regular season winning percentage in league history of .698 (only Steve Kerr and Phil Jackson are ahead of him). He is still the winningest coach in Sixers history. Cunningham joined the broadcast team for CBS in the 1976-77 season, often paired with Brent Musburger, leaving after the season ended to coach the 76ers. Cunningham would later rejoin the CBS broadcast team starting with the 1985-86 season, again often paired with Musburger. In 1987, Cunningham replaced Tom Heinsohn as the lead color commentator (alongside play-by-play man Dick Stockton) for CBS' NBA telecasts. Cunningham left CBS Sports the following season to join the Miami Heat expansion franchise as a minority owner; he ultimately sold his interest of the Heat on August 12, 1994. Cunningham was subsequently replaced on CBS by Hubie Brown.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/78.png

He succeeded Wally Marks and led the Sycamores to 8 consecutive winning seasons and three berths in the NAIA Men's Basketball Championships (1942, 1943 & 1946); reaching the national quarterfinals in 1942 and the title game in 1946. He finished his career as the leader in wins and then recommended his old high school player and protégé John Wooden as his successor. Additionally, he served as the athletic director during his coaching tenure. In 1998, Curtis was inducted into the Indiana State University Athletics Hall of Fame.[4] Prior to becoming a collegiate coach, Curtis, known as the 'Ole Fox' by his peers, spent 21 years as an Indiana High School coach. His first year as head coach came at Lebanon High School in Lebanon, Indiana. During his one-year stint, he went 28–2 (.933) and won the 1918 state championship. He then moved to Mooresville where he spent one semester, coaching approximately 10 games. At the Christmas break, he moved to nearby Martinsville. His Martinsville Artesians won 396 games and lost 139 (.740). During his tenure (1919 to 1938), they won 16 sectional championships, 14 regional championships and three state championships. Coaching players such as John Wooden and fellow Indiana Basketball Hall of Famers Lester Reynolds and Arnold Suddith, he won state titles in 1924, 1927, and 1933, with Wooden the star in 1927. The Artesians lost the state championship in 1926 and 1928. In the five years from 1924 through 1928, they were in the state championship game every year but 1925. He was the first Indiana high school coach (and one of four) to win four state championships. Curtis was the co-head coach with Tony Hinkle of the first Indiana all-star team to play Kentucky and he also coached six Indianapolis Star all-star teams. He never had a losing season as a coach, and in 19 years at Martinsville, his teams won 16 sectional championships (the opening round of the state playoffs) and 14 regional championships (the equivalent to making the NCAA Sweet Sixteen.) He returned to the high school ranks as the Martinsville Superintendent of Schools from 1948–1955. Curtis died in 1958.[5] The Martinsville High School Gymnasium was named in his honor in 1959.[6]:2, 6 He moved on to the professional ranks, briefly coaching the Detroit Falcons of the Basketball Association of America (BAA).

81,Mike D'Antoni,"May 8, 1951",,"Mullens in Mullens, West Virginia",Marshall,1999,2020,16,false,,"""[8, 2, 2, 1, 1]""",/coaches/dantomi01c.html,"Michael Andrew D'Antoni (born May 8, 1951)[1] is an American-Italian professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach of the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). While head coach of the Phoenix Suns, he won NBA Coach of the Year honors for the 2004–05 NBA season after the Suns posted 33 more wins than the previous season. He coached the New York Knicks starting in 2008 before resigning in 2012. He was hired by the Lakers seven games into the 2012–13 season. On June 1, 2016, D'Antoni was named head coach of the Rockets, and he received his second NBA Coach of the Year award for the 2016–17 season.[2] D'Antoni, who holds American and Italian dual citizenship, is known for favoring a fast-paced, offense-oriented system. After playing high school basketball at Mullens High School, in Mullens, West Virginia, D'Antoni played college basketball at Marshall University, with the Thundering Herd, from 1970 to 1973. After a college basketball career at Marshall University, D'Antoni was drafted by the Kansas City-Omaha Kings in the second round of the 1973 NBA draft. After playing three seasons for the Kings (1973–1975), he played for the Spirits of St. Louis of the American Basketball Association (ABA) in 1975–76, and for the San Antonio Spurs (again in the NBA) in 1976–77. His Spurs career lasted just two games, before he found an opportunity to play overseas. D'Antoni was signed by the Italian team Olimpia Milano, starting a career that saw him become the club's all-time leading scorer. He was voted the Italian LBA league's top point guard of all time in 1990,[3] and paced his team to five Italian League titles, two FIBA European Champions Cup (now called EuroLeague) titles, two Italian Cups, one FIBA Korać Cup, and one FIBA Intercontinental Cup. During his playing career in Italy, D'Antoni earned the nickname ""Il Baffo"" (Italian for ""The Mustache""), in reference to his ever-present facial hair.[4] He also earned the nickname ""Arsène Lupin"" because of his ability to steal the ball.[5] In 2015, Olimpia Milano retired his No. 8 jersey, in order to honor him. Being of Italian origin, D'Antoni was also selected to play on the senior men's Italian national team for the EuroBasket tournament in 1989.[6][7] D’Antoni began his career as head coach for his most loyal club, Olimpia Milan. He remained there for four seasons, from 1990 to 1994, leading the club to a 1992 FIBA EuroLeague Final Four appearance, and a 1992–93 season FIBA Korać Cup title. He was then chosen to coach Benetton Treviso, another major Italian league basketball club. During his tenure with Treviso (1994–1997), the team captured the FIBA European Cup (later renamed Saporta Cup) and Italian Cup (in 1995), and won the Italian national domestic league title in the 1996–97 season. Coach D’Antoni's Italian club teams went to the Italian League's playoffs each season. In 2001, D'Antoni returned to Italy for a second stint, as the coach of Benetton Treviso. In his one season back in Europe, he led Treviso to a 28–8 regular season record in the Italian League, an Italian League championship, and to a 2002 Euroleague Final Four appearance, coaching a team filled with many former NBA stars. D'Antoni's first NBA coaching job was with the Denver Nuggets in 1997–98 as the club's director of player personnel. He also did some broadcasting work with TNT that season. The next year, he became the Nuggets' head coach, but was fired after a poor performance during the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. D'Antoni then became a scout for San Antonio Spurs during the 1999–2000 season. He was also an assistant for the Portland Trail Blazers in 2000–01. In 2002, D'Antoni made his return to the NBA as a Phoenix Suns assistant under Frank Johnson. In 2003, he replaced Johnson with 61 games left in the season as the Suns' head coach and,[8] despite the team's failure to improve in the second half of the season, received a vote of confidence for producing inspired play from the injury-riddled team. With the acquisition of free agent Steve Nash before the 2004–05 season, an incredible turnaround began for the team. Nash was experienced in the run-and-gun style from his previous stints with the Dallas Mavericks and the Suns. He excelled running D'Antoni's pick-and-roll offense.[9] D'Antoni won the NBA Coach of the Year Award after his Suns went 62–20 to finish first in the regular season. His style, dubbed ""Seven Seconds or Less"", was described in a book of that name. Overall, his Suns won 50 or more games in four consecutive seasons, while Nash earned NBA MVP honors in 2005 and 2006. In addition to Nash, D'Antoni's Suns also featured All-Star power forward Amar'e Stoudemire and high-flying small forward Shawn Marion. They made consecutive appearances in the Western Conference finals in 2005 and 2006, losing to the San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks, respectively.[9] D'Antoni became the Suns' GM after Bryan Colangelo's departure and passed on the post to Steve Kerr in 2007.[10] The Suns were eliminated in the playoffs by the Spurs in 2007 and 2008, after which D'Antoni left Phoenix for the New York Knicks. D'Antoni was selected to the coaching staff for the Team USA Olympic Basketball squad under head coach Mike Krzyzewski and participated in the 2006 FIBA World Championship, winning a bronze medal.[11] Pundits believed his familiarity with the three-point shot and the zone defense, hallmarks of the international game, were valuable assets to the team.[citation needed] Although Steve Kerr requested he stay with the Suns, D'Antoni was told that he was free to speak with other teams about coaching jobs.[12] On May 9, D'Antoni was made an offer by the New York Knicks.[13] The next day, he accepted the 4-year, $24 million offer and became the Knicks' head coach.[14][15] After two losing seasons, D'Antoni with new additions Amar'e Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony led the Knicks to the playoffs in 2010–11 with a 42–40 record. They were swept by the Boston Celtics in the first round. D'Antoni resigned as coach on March 14, 2012, and assistant coach Mike Woodson filled his vacancy as the head coach.[16] The Knicks were off to a disappointing 18–24 start, and D'Antoni clashed with Anthony.[9] In the summer of 2012, D'Antoni returned to Team USA as an assistant coach again under head coach Mike Krzyzewski. He reunited with Knicks players Carmelo Anthony and Tyson Chandler on this team as they prepared for the 2012 London Summer Olympics.[17] On November 12, 2012, the Lakers signed D'Antoni to a three-year contract worth $12 million.[18][19] He replaced Mike Brown, who was fired as head coach after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season. The Lakers first contacted former Lakers coach Phil Jackson about the opening, but D'Antoni was hired in a unanimous decision by the Lakers front office.[9][20][21][22] The Lakers felt that D'Antoni's fast-paced style of play made him a ""great fit"" for the team, more suitable than Jackson's structured triangle offense.[20][21][23][24] Lakers owner Jerry Buss's preference has always been for the Lakers to have a wide-open offense.[20] D'Antoni was reunited with Nash, who was traded to the Lakers before the season. Lakers star Kobe Bryant was also familiar with D'Antoni; Bryant as a child knew him when D'Antoni was a star in Italy and Bryant's father was also playing there. Bryant grew close to D'Antoni during their time with Team USA.[9][22] D'Antoni's coaching debut with the Lakers was delayed as he recovered from knee replacement surgery. He had surgery weeks before on October 31, as he originally expected to take a year off from coaching and have months to recover.[25] Bernie Bickerstaff, who was the Lakers' interim coach after Brown was fired, continued in that role after D'Antoni was hired.[26] He was 4–1 as the interim coach, winning his last two as D'Antoni started leading team practices.[27][28] D'Antoni named a new assistant to the Lakers' staff, his older brother Dan, who also helped with the practices. In his first press conference, D'Antoni predicted that the Lakers, then 3–5 and ranked 20th in scoring with 96.5 points per game, should instead be scoring ""110–115 points a game"".[27] He wanted to revive Showtime.[29] He reiterated general manager Mitch Kupchak's belief that the Lakers were built to win an NBA championship that season. D'Antoni was glad to be back with Nash, noting his unsuccessful stint with the Knicks without him.[27] On November 20, he coached his first game—nine days after he was hired—in a 95–90 win against the Brooklyn Nets.[30] In his first game back in New York in December, the Lakers lost 116–107 and dropped to 4–9 overall under D'Antoni.[31] D'Antoni coached his first 17 games without Nash, who was recovering from a broken leg.[32] The Lakers won three out of four after Nash returned in late December, but proceeded to lose their next six.[33][34] Calling it a permanent move, D'Antoni benched forward Pau Gasol in mid-January and started Earl Clark to form the faster and smaller lineup the coach preferred.[35][36][37] The team was already ranked No. 2 in pace.[36] Halfway through the season, the Lakers were in 12th place in the Western Conference with a 17–24 record. Under D'Antoni, the Lakers were 12-19 while scoring an average of 103.3 points a game but surrendering 103.4.[38] Offensively, they reached the 110-point threshold just eight times in the 31 games, going 5–3.[39] D'Antoni stressed that the team's focus needed to be on its defense, not offense.[40] He likened the Lakers to an All-Star team in which ""everybody gets the ball and goes one on one and then they play no defense"",[41] adding that they ""haven't learned that there's a pecking order"" where stars need to know their roles.[41] Nash struggled with center Dwight Howard to run the pick and roll, a play D'Antoni expected to be a staple for the Lakers.[42] D'Antoni eventually dropped his offense and played without any system.[43][44] ""We play basketball. The system is move the ball, play hard defense, space the floor and who's open shoots. It's not a difficult thing"", said D'Antoni.[44] The coach moved Nash off the ball and made him more of a spot-up shooter, while Bryant became the primary facilitator on offense.[43][44][45] The defense was also more energized.[46] D'Antoni was named Western Conference Coach of the Month after the Lakers went 7–1 in April. They finished the season 28–12 after dropping to 17–25 in January the day of their team meeting in Memphis.[47] They qualified for the playoffs on the final day of the season, securing the seventh seed in the West.[48] The Lakers' expected starting five of Bryant, Nash, Howard, Gasol and Metta World Peace started together just seven times all season and without registering a win.[49] ""The Lakers didn't help things by making the coaching change and putting [D'Antoni] in that situation, which he was glad to take. But I think it was a little bit tougher than he thought it would be"", Kupchak said.[47] The Lakers faced San Antonio in the playoffs and lost in the opening round for the first time since 2007, suffering their first opening-round sweep since 1967.[50] In D'Antoni's first full season with the team in 2013–14, the Lakers went 27–55 for the second-worst winning percentage (.329) in team history. It was the worst 82-game record in team history and their fewest wins since the franchise moved from Minnesota.[51] Howard left before the season as a free agent, accepting less money to join the Houston Rockets.[52] Bryant played in just six games during the season, but he and Gasol were critical of D'Antoni's small-ball system.[53] Nash also missed most of the season with injuries.[52] On April 30, 2014, D'Antoni resigned as coach of the Lakers after the team declined to pick up their option for him to coach in 2015–16. He was paid an undisclosed amount of the $4 million owed him for the upcoming 2014–15 season. ""Given the circumstances, I don't know that anybody could have done a better job than Mike did the past two seasons"", said Kupchak.[53] On December 18, 2015, D'Antoni signed with the Philadelphia 76ers to work as associate head coach under Brett Brown.[54] On June 1, 2016, D'Antoni was named the new head coach of the Houston Rockets.[2] On May 7, 2017, D'Antoni and Erik Spoelstra were announced as co-recipients of the inaugural Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award.[55] On June 26, 2017, he won the NBA Coach of the Year Award. After the 2018–19 season, the Rockets have won more games in his three seasons than in any three-year stretch in franchise history (173–73). The Rockets are 23–16 in that same span.[56] In the 2018 playoffs, D'Antoni led the team to their first Western Conference Finals since 2015. He accumulated the best win-percentage of any Rockets coach.[57] On May 30, 2019, after the considerable dismantling of the coaching staff,[58] D'Antoni announced that he decided not to renew his contract which was set to expire after the 2019–20 season.[59] Prior to the announcement, he showed interest in signing a contract extension, stating: ""I've let Daryl and [owner] Tilman [Fertitta] know that I'm energized to keep coaching – and believe that I can continue to do this at a high-level for at least another three years.""[60] On June 8, after a Golden State Warriors loss (1–3) to the Toronto Raptors in the NBA Finals, it was announced that Fertitta and D’Antoni were nearing an agreement on a contract extension after the language of a buyout was removed from the previous offer—which is what caused the initial talks to die out in the first place.[61][56] D'Antoni was born in Mullens, West Virginia, and played basketball at Marshall University. His father was a high school basketball coach in West Virginia and Ohio, and was inducted into West Virginia's Sports Hall of Fame. His older brother Dan coached under him as an assistant in Phoenix, New York, and Los Angeles.[62] Both Mike (1997) and Dan (1990) have been enshrined in the Marshall University Athletics Hall of Fame. D'Antoni is a dual citizen of the United States and Italy, making him the first Italian to lead an NBA team. He descends from an Italian grandfather who emigrated from Umbria, Italy, to the U.S. in the first years of the 20th century.[63] He is fluent in English and Italian.[64] He lives in the Memorial neighborhood in Houston, with his wife, Laurel, and has a son, also named Mike.[65]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/81.png

He led the Detroit Pistons two consecutive National Basketball Association (NBA) Championships in 1989 and 1990, and the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (""The Dream Team"") to the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics.[1] Daly is a two-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, being inducted in 1994 for his individual coaching career,[2] and in 2010 was posthumously inducted as the head coach of the ""Dream Team"".[3] The Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award is named after him.[4] Born in Kane, Pennsylvania, to Earl and Geraldine Daly on July 20, 1930, Daly attended Kane Area High School. He matriculated at St. Bonaventure University for one year before transferring to Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1952.[5] After serving two years in the military, he began his basketball coaching career in 1955 at Punxsutawney Area High School in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.[1] After compiling a 111–70 record in eight seasons[5] at Punxsutawney High School, Daly moved on to the college level in 1963 as an assistant coach under Vic Bubas at Duke University. During his six seasons at Duke, the Blue Devils won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship and advanced to the Final Four, both in 1964 and 1966.[6] Daly then replaced Bob Cousy as head coach at Boston College in 1969. The Eagles recorded an 11–13 record in Daly's first year at the school, and improved to 15–11 in 1971.[7] Daly became the head coach at the University of Pennsylvania in 1971, succeeding Dick Harter. Penn won twenty or more games and captured the Ivy League title in each of its first four seasons with Daly at the helm.[8] The most successful campaign was his first in 1972, when the Quakers recorded a 25–3 record overall (13–1 in their conference), and advanced to the NCAA East Regional Final, eventually losing to North Carolina.[9] An additional significant success for Daly was in 1979, when all five starters on Pennsylvania's Final Four team had initially been recruited by Daly.[8] His overall record after six seasons at Penn was 125–38 (74–10 within the Ivy League). In 1978, Daly joined the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers as an assistant coach. During the 1981 season, the Cleveland Cavaliers hired him as the third head coach that season, but was fired with a 9-32 record before the season ended.[10] He then returned to the 76ers as a broadcaster until he was hired in 1983 by the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons, a club that had never recorded back-to-back winning seasons before Daly's tenure, made the NBA playoffs each year he was head coach (1983–1992), as well as reaching the NBA finals three times, winning two consecutive NBA championships in 1989 and 1990. While serving as the Pistons coach, Daly was also a color commentator for TBS's NBA Playoff coverage. Daly was named head coach of the U.S. Dream Team that won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics,[3] before moving his NBA career onto the New Jersey Nets for the 1992–93 season. Daly stayed with the Nets for two seasons, before resigning over frustration over the immaturity of some of the players on his team.[11] Daly again took up a role as color commentator for TNT's NBA coverage during the mid-1990s. Daly rejected an offer to coach the New York Knicks over the Summer of 1995 after deciding he wasn't ready for the NBA coaching grind.[12] He would return to coaching with the Orlando Magic at the beginning of the 1997–98 season. Daly stayed two seasons with the Magic and then retired permanently. Daly was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in March 2009 and died on May 9, 2009, at the age of 78.[1] He is survived by his wife Terry, daughter Cydney, and two grandchildren. He is buried at Riverside Memorial Park in Tequesta, Florida.[13]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/82.png
83,Mel Daniels,"July 20, 1944","October 30, 2015","Pershing in Detroit, Michigan",New Mexico,1989,1989,1,true,,"""[1]""",/coaches/danieme01c.html,"Melvin Joe Daniels (July 20, 1944 – October 30, 2015) was an American professional basketball player. He played in the American Basketball Association (ABA) for the Minnesota Muskies, Indiana Pacers, and Memphis Sounds, and in the National Basketball Association for the New York Nets. Daniels was a two-time ABA Most Valuable Player, three-time ABA Champion and a seven-time ABA All-Star. Daniels was the All-time ABA rebounding leader. Daniels was enshrined into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012. The son of Maceo and Bernice Daniels, Mel Daniels moved with his family back to his birthplace of Detroit, Michigan from Lincoln, North Carolina when Mel was a toddler. Mel had two sisters. Back in Detroit, the family first lived with Mel's grandfather, then in a tenement on 8 Mile Road and finally in a house on McDougall Street. Maceo Daniels worked in an automobile parts factory.[1] Bernice read poetry to Mel. He began writing poems by age eight and continued to write them throughout the rest of his life, generally focusing on the lives of athletes, but wrote poems about non-sports topics as well. Daniels mostly did not share his poems with his teammates, “This is the side I’ve kept quiet,” he said of his poems.[2] Daniels attended Pershing High School in Detroit, Michigan. Pershing also produced Spencer Haywood, Ralph Simpson, Kevin Willis Ted Sizemore and Steve Smith. Will Robinson, physical education teacher and basketball coach at Pershing High School, recalled Daniels being absent from PE class for a few weeks. So Mr. Robinson went looking for the truant Daniels and finally found him in the hallway and ordered him to the gym. A few days later, Daniels still had not appeared in class, so Robinson went looking for him again. The way Mel Daniels, then a sophomore, remembered it, he was ordered by Coach Robinson to report to the gymnasium at 3:30 to join the basketball team.[1] ""Chief, I want you in the gym today,"" Daniels recalled Coach Robinson telling him. ""If you're not in the gym, I'm going to come get you and beat your a—.""[1] Will Robinson would win two state championships at Pershing, become the first black NCAA Division I coach at Illinois State in 1970 and later scout for the NFL Detroit Lions and NBA Detroit Pistons.[1] Daniels was slow to earn playing time in high school, playing sparingly in junior varsity games his first two seasons. He was also slow in running fitness laps under Coach Robinson's direction. ""Jesus Christ, he would always be a bad last,"" Robinson recalled. ""Not just last, but a bad last. The guys would lap him. He had a winning spirit. He tried all the time after he found out the swing of things.""[1] Ted Sizemore, later a major league baseball player, was a high school basketball teammate of Daniels and recalled, ""Will (Robinson) worked him. One thing Mel never did was give up. He kept coming back and Will made him work, work, work. He just kept developing and developing. He just did a lot of work. A lot of drills, footwork, handling the ball. He just got coordinated all of a sudden.""[1] After growing to 6'9"", Daniels showed his potential as a senior and Robinson helped him secure a scholarship at Burlington Community College in Iowa.[1] Daniels continued to improve in college. Playing the 1963-1964 season at Burlington Community College in Burlington, Iowa, Daniels averaged 25.2 points and 10.0 rebounds and was named a Junior College All-American.[3] While at Burlington, Dainiels was recruited to play for the University of New Mexico Lobos by coach Bob King. Daniels transferred, played for New Mexico from 1964-1967, averaged 20 points per game in his New Mexico Lobo career and was named an All-American.[4] Starting as a sophomore in 1964-65, the 6-9 power forward played in 27 games and averaged 17.0 points and 11.2 rebounds as New Mexico finished 19-8.[5] During the 1965-66 season, Daniels suffered a severe injury when he put his arm through a glass door at Johnson Gymnasium, requiring 352 stitches and almost ending his athletic career.[6] The sutures notwithstanding, Daniels missed one game and averaged 21.2 points and 10.3 rebounds as the Lobos finished 16-8.[7] The 1966-67 team won a school-record 17 straight games to start the season as New Mexico climbed to No. 3 in the national rankings. Daniels led the Western Athletic Conference in scoring at 21.5 points, along with 11.6 rebounds as New Mexico finished 19-8.[6][8] For his career, Daniels averaged 20.0 points and 11.1 rebounds in 77 games at New Mexico. He had 44 career double-doubles, still the most in school history.[9][10] Daniels was the ninth pick of the 1967 NBA draft, selected by the Cincinnati Royals, and was also drafted by the Minnesota Muskies of the American Basketball Association (ABA). He chose to play in the fledgling ABA.[11] After rejecting Cincinnati (with Oscar Robertson), Daniels became the first NBA first-round pick to snub the established league and go to the ABA. ""At that time, it wasn't about money for me. But y'know, 2 + 2 is still 4,"" Daniels said of his decision to go to the ABA. ""I was offered $15,000 by Cincinnati as a bonus and $17,500 as a salary. I was offered $15,000 as a bonus in Minnesota and $30,000 as a salary. So the higher number somehow won out.""[12] Daniels' decision to play in the ABA led to great success for him. Daniels won three ABA Championships, was a two-time ABA Most Valuable Player, a seven time ABA All-star and led the ABA in rebounding average in three different seasons. Daniels is the ABA's all-time leader in total rebounds and second in ABA career average rebounds (15.12) behind only fellow Hall of Famer Artis Gilmore of the Kentucky Colonels (17.07).[13][14][13] Daniels had 1,608 career postseason rebounds in the ABA.[14] As a rookie in 1967–68 with the Minnesota Muskies, Daniels was named the American Basketball Association Rookie of the Year. He averaged 22.2 points and a league leading 15.6 rebounds in 78 games, as Minnesota finished 50-28 under coach Jim Pollard. Minnesota lost to the eventual ABA Champion Pittsburgh Pipers with Connie Hawkins in the 1968 ABA Playoffs, as Daniels averaged 25.3 points and 16.1 rebounds in 10 playoff games. After the 1967-1968 season, Daniels was traded to the Indiana Pacers for cash (reportedly, $75,000), Jimmy Dawson and Ron Kozlicki, as Minnesota was experiencing financial difficulty. Minnesota moved to become the Miami Floridians after the one season in Minnesota.[15][16][17][18] With Indiana in 1968-1969, Daniels was named the ABA Most Valuable Player as he averaged 24.0 points and an ABA leading 16.5 rebounds. With Hall of Fame Coach Slick Leonard taking over from Larry Staverman as the Pacers coach early in the season, in the 1969 ABA Playoffs, Indiana defeated the Kentucky Colonels 4-3, Daniels' former team, the Miami Floridians 4-1 before losing to the Oakland Oaks with Rick Barry 4-1 in the 1969 ABA Finals.[19] ""Slick was one of the most creative, innovative coaches ever,"" Daniels said of his longtime Pacers coach. ""He would change our offense at halftime. He'd create six new plays and we executed them the way he drew them up on the board.""[12] In 1969-1970, Indiana won the 1970 ABA championship with a 4-2 series win over the Los Angeles Stars in the ABA Finals. Daniels averaged 18.7 points and 17.6 rebounds in the regular season, as Indiana finished 59-25. Hall of Famer Roger Brown, Bob Netolicky John Barnhill and Freddie Lewis helped lead the Pacers to the ABA Title. Daniels averaged 19.3 points and 17.7 rebounds in the playoffs.[20] In 1970-1971, the Pacers finished 58-26, as Daniels was again named the ABA Most Valuable Player. He averaged 21.0 points, a league leading 18.0 rebounds and 2.2 assists. The Pacers were defeated by the Utah Stars 4-3 in the Western Division Finals in the 1971 ABA Playoffs. Daniels averaged 21.4 points and 19.2 rebounds in the playoffs.[21] In 1971-1972 the Pacers added Hall of Famer George McGinnis. They then won their second ABA Title, as they defeated the Denver Rockets 4-3, the Utah Stars 4-3 and the New York Nets with Rick Barry 4-2 in the 1972 ABA Finals. Daniels averaged 19.2 points, 16.4 rebounds and 2.2 assists as Indiana finished the regular season 47-37. Daniels averaged 15.3 points and 15.1 rebounds in the playoffs.[22][23] The Pacers won their third ABA Championship in 1972-1973. Daniels averaged 18.5 points and 15.4 rebounds alongside McGinnis (27.6 points and 12.5 rebounds), as Indiana finished 51-33. In the 1973 ABA Playoffs, Indiana defeated the Denver Rockets 4-1 and the Utah Stars 4-2. In the 1973 ABA Finals the Pacers defeated the Kentucky Colonels with Hall of Famers Artis Gilmore, Dan Issel, Louis Dampier and former Pacer teammate Rick Mount 4-3 to capture the ABA Championship. Daniels averaged 15.9 points and 13.8 rebounds in the playoffs.[24][25] In his last season in Indiana, Daniels averaged a double-double 15.4 points and 11.6 rebounds in 1973-1974. The Pacers finished 46-38 and lost to the Utah Stars in the Western Conference finals in the 1974 ABA Playoffs, with Daniels averaging 12.2 points and 11.4 rebounds in the playoffs.[26] ""He was the leader on the ballclub,"" said Coach Slick Leonard of Daniels. ""He expected his teammates to bring it every night and he would get on 'em. But off the floor, he was like a big bear.""[12] In 479 career games with the Indiana Pacers, Daniels averaged 19.0 points and 16.4 rebounds.[27] In 1974-1975, Daniels (along with Freddie Lewis) was traded to the Memphis Sounds for Charles Edge. Roger Brown joined them in Memphis as well. Early in the season, Daniels suffered pulled stomach muscles and missed a month. Then, he fell in a bathtub and injured his back, ending up back on injured list. His back problems were chronic .Daniels averaged 9.8 points and 9.0 rebounds.[28][29][18][30] ""I was traded (to Memphis) with the understanding that we'd play together,"" Daniels recalled of his Memphis experience. ""But Roger was traded to Utah and Freddie went to St. Louis. We were lied to. Then I hurt my back. Everything kind of fell apart. I never got my passion for the game back. Once you're lied to, you lose respect for the people who did it to you. You start doubting yourself a little bit. And your boys are gone.""[12] In 1975-1976, the Memphis Sounds relocated and became the Baltimore Claws. The Baltimore franchise was suddenly disbanded after three exhibition games due to financial difficulties. Daniels said at the time: ""It just seems unbelievable. I've been around the ABA for nine years and felt this would be the most solid year and now this happens. We worked hard and wanted something good to happen with this team. The guys feel it is part of our lives that has been swooped away. We tried hard to keep it together by working real hard in practice even when we weren't getting paid. But now it's all over and we're all down in the dumps.""[31] The Baltimore Claws players were then available to other ABA teams in an special draft. The 31-year-old Daniels was passed over in the resulting dispersal draft, as other teams were likely wary of assuming the contract he had with Baltimore. Daniels decided to retire from the league rather than play for another ABA team.[31] He then played in Italy during the 1975-1976 season.[2][32][18] After the 1976 ABA-NBA merger, the San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets, New York Nets and Indiana Pacers merged with the NBA. The remaining ABA teams were disbanded. On October 19, 1976, Daniels signed as a free agent with the New York Nets and on December 13, 1976 he was waived by the Nets and retired. Daniels had played with the Nets for 11 games during the 1976–77 season.[27][30] “I loved to knock guys down,” Daniels said in “Loose Balls” (1990). “When you went to the boards, you did it with your elbows out. If there was a fight, it wasn’t just one-on-one, it was 12-on-12. The fine for fighting was $25. That wasn’t going to stop any fights.”[2] “Mel was the anchor,” Pacers teammate and best-friend Bob Netolicky said of Daniels. “Had Mel not came to this team, I can guarantee you 100 percent we wouldn’t be sitting down at (Bankers Life Fieldhouse). Had we not had the success we had, they would’ve folded the team. The thing I hope people understand, they have no idea how important this guy was to the city (of Indianapolis).”[17] Daniels is the ABA’s all-time leader with 9,494 rebounds and is second in ABA history with an average of 15.1 rebounds per game. He is fourth in ABA total points, with 11,739, ninth with 628 games, fourth with 22,340 minutes and 10th with 351 ABA blocked shots.[27][18] Overall, in his ABA/NBA career, Daniels averaged a double-double of 18.4 points and 14.9 rebounds in 639 career games. In 109 playoff games, he averaged 17.4 points and 14.9 rebounds.[27] After retiring as a player, Daniels joined the coaching staff of his college coach, Bob King, at Indiana State University. There he coached future Hall of Famer Larry Bird and helped the Sycamores reach the 1979 NCAA Final, where they were defeated by Magic Johnson and Michigan State ending an undefeated season. After his tenure at Indiana State, Daniels joined the Indiana Pacers coaching staff in 1986. After seven seasons an assistant coach, he moved to scouting and eventually the front office and was the team's Director of Player Personnel until October 2009.[33] Daniels had a 0-2 record as interim coach of the Pacers in 1988-89. He replaced Jack Ramsay, who was fired after an 0-7 start. George Irvine and later Dick Versace were the head coaches who followed.[18] Daniels died on October 30, 2015, at the age of 71, from complications after heart surgery.[34] He was survived by his wife, CeCe Daniels, son Mel Daniels Jr., two granddaughters, and two sisters.[35] A lover of horses, Daniels lived on a ranch in Sheridan, Indiana at the time of his death.[2] Daniels was longtime friends with Ira Harge, a teammate at New Mexico and was very close with Bob Netolicky, his Pacers teammate.[10][36] Daniels appeared in 30 for 30 Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs. The New York Knicks (documentary, 2010), Magic vs. Bird: The 1979 NCAA Championship Game (TV special, 1979) and Undefeated: The Roger Brown Story (TV Movie, 2013).[37] A poet, Mel Daniels, wrote more than 20,000 poems in his lifetime.

The team joined the National Basketball League in the 1948–49 season, and Darden averaged 10.3 points per game in his first year of playing professional basketball.[1] The Nuggets became a part of the National Basketball Association in the league's inaugural 1949–50 season, and Darden served as a player-coach for the team.

In 1996, DeBusschere was named as one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history. DeBusschere was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. DeBusschere was born in Detroit to parents Peter Marcell and Dorothy Debusschere.[1] He attended Austin Catholic Preparatory School and inspired the ""White Shirted Legion"" (the tradition of wearing white shirts to the school's games to make fans more visible). As a junior, he was named all-state, and in his senior year of 1957–58, in just the school's third year of organized basketball, he led his team to the Michigan Class A high school basketball championship, scoring 32 points despite fouling out midway through the fourth quarter as the Friars defeated Benton Harbor High School and Debusschere's future NBA rival forward Chet Walker.[2] DeBusschere starred in both basketball and baseball at the University of Detroit. He averaged 24 points a game in basketball, helping Detroit reach the National Invitation Tournament twice and the NCAA basketball tournament once. He also pitched the Titans to three NCAA baseball tournament berths.[3] In 1962, DeBusschere was signed by the Chicago White Sox as an amateur free agent. He was a pitcher for the White Sox from 1962 to 1963. He pitched a shutout on August 13, 1963, against the Cleveland Indians, giving up six hits, one walk and striking out three. In 22 career at bats, he had only one hit, a single off Bennie Daniels on July 17, 1963. He pitched in the White Sox's minor league system for two more seasons before giving up pitching to focus on both playing and coaching basketball.[4] He is one of only 13 athletes to have played in both the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball. The 13 are: Danny Ainge, Frank Baumholtz, Gene Conley, Chuck Connors, DeBusschere, Johnny Gee, Dick Groat, Steve Hamilton, Mark Hendrickson, Cotton Nash, Ron Reed, Dick Ricketts and Howie Schultz.[5].[6][7][8] DeBusschere was selected by the Detroit Pistons in 1962 NBA draft as a territorial draft selection. During his rookie season, he averaged 12.7 points and 8.7 rebounds per game, and was later named to the NBA All-Rookie Team. However, DeBusschere was injured during his second season and only played in 15 games, resulting in the Pistons finishing with a disappointing record of 23-59. In the 1964–1965 season, at the age of 24, he was given the position of player-coach for the Pistons, and thus became the youngest-ever coach in league history. However, this stint as coach was not successful and he became a full-time player. During the 1968–1969 season, DeBusschere was traded to the New York Knicks for Walt Bellamy and Howard Komives. While a member of the Pistons, DeBusschere appeared as himself on the April 29, 1963 episode of the game show to To Tell the Truth. He received two votes.[9] DeBusschere, along with future Hall of Famers Willis Reed, Bill Bradley and Walt Frazier, became an NBA champion when the Knicks defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1970 NBA Finals. With Earl Monroe in the backcourt, they became champions again in 1973, beating the Lakers 4-1 in the finals. DeBusschere was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1983 after a 12-year career (1962–1974) in which he averaged 16.1 points and 11 rebounds while being named to eight NBA All-Star teams. He became a member of the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996. He was renowned for his physical style of play and tenacious defense, and he was named to the NBA All-Defensive first team six times.[10] DeBusschere retired as a player in 1974, and his #22 jersey was retired by the Knicks, though not until many years later; it is thought the delay was due to his taking a front-office job with the rival New York Nets of the American Basketball Association (now Brooklyn Nets) upon his retirement. The next year DeBusschere became the ABA's commissioner for the 1975–76 season, its last. DeBusschere helped bring about the merger between the NBA and the ABA that year.[11] He was later the assistant coach and director of basketball operation of the Knicks during the 1980s, when he drafted fellow Knicks legend Patrick Ewing, the first overall selection in 1985. DeBusschere and some partners purchased Ring magazine in 1979.[12] DeBusschere authored a book entitled The Open Man, a chronicle of the New York Knicks' 1969–1970 championship season. In May 2003, Dave DeBusschere collapsed on a Manhattan street from a heart attack and was pronounced dead at New York University Hospital. He was 62 years of age. DeBusschere was interred at Saint Joseph's Church Cemetery in Garden City, Nassau County, New York. DeBusschere, who lived in Garden City, was survived by his wife, Gerri (who died of cancer in 2009),[13] sons Peter and Dennis, and daughter Michelle.[3] In his honor, the University of Detroit Mercy inaugurated the Dave DeBusschere Scholarship in 2003. It provides support to two student-athletes that must have a minimum grade point average of 3.0 and have demonstrated exceptional leadership skills.[13]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/86.png

Dehnert's greatest coup during his time in Sheboygan was his signing of three East Coast stars: Al Lucas of Fordham, Al Moschetti of St. John's and Bobby Holm of Seton Hall. Buoyed by this added strength, the Red Skins took a 2-0 lead over the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons in the 1945 NBL championship series, only to be swept in the remaining three games. In 1946, Dehnert led Sheboygan to a meeting with the vaunted Rochester Royals in the championship series. Rochester swept the Red Skins.

He was the head coach of the National Basketball Association's Chicago Bulls from 2008 to 2010, and the Los Angeles Clippers from 2010 to 2013. Del Negro is currently an analyst with NBA TV. Del Negro was born on August 9, 1966, in Springfield, Massachusetts. His father, Vince, was a two-time junior college All-American, and taught his son to play basketball at a young age. Vinny made the varsity basketball team during his freshman year at Cathedral High School. He caught the attention of Dennis Kinne, the basketball coach at Suffield Academy, who persuaded him to attend Suffield Academy so that he could play basketball for them. Vinny led Suffield Academy to two New England championships. He scored 1,116 points, becoming Suffield Academy's all-time leading scorer.[1] Del Negro played for Jim Valvano at North Carolina State University. As a senior, he was selected to the All-Atlantic Coast Conference team after averaging 15.9 points, 3.6 assists and 4.9 rebounds per game. In his junior season, Del Negro led the Wolfpack to the 1987 ACC Tournament championship and was named tournament MVP. Del Negro was selected by the Sacramento Kings with the 29th pick in the 1988 NBA draft. He would play two seasons there before leaving for Italy and Benetton Treviso for another two years (he won the Italian championship in 1992 with over 25 points per game). Upon his return to the NBA, Del Negro played for the San Antonio Spurs for the next six years. In early 1999 he played four games in Italy for Teamsystem Bologna, before signing with the Milwaukee Bucks, where he played in the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 seasons. Del Negro was traded to the Golden State Warriors in a three-team deal that also involved the Cleveland Cavaliers in June 2000. In January 2001 he was traded to the Phoenix Suns, and was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in a three-team deal with the Orlando Magic in November, although he would never play for them, and subsequently retired. Del Negro's career statistics included averaging 9.1 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game, while shooting 47.5% from the field and 84.0% from the free-throw line. Del Negro worked as a radio commentator for the Phoenix Suns before being promoted to director of player personnel for the Suns in 2006.[2] In 2007, the Suns promoted him to the position of assistant general manager.[3] On June 9, 2008, multiple media reports indicated Del Negro had agreed to become the new head coach of the Chicago Bulls.[4] He became the favorite for the job after former Bulls' coach Doug Collins withdrew his name from consideration. Two days later, Del Negro was officially introduced as the new head coach of the Bulls, replacing Jim Boylan and becoming the 17th head coach in Bulls' history. Del Negro finished his first season as head coach of the Chicago Bulls with a 41–41 record, sufficient for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. The Bulls played a seven-game series against the Boston Celtics, featuring four overtime games with a total of a record seven overtime periods, before losing. Del Negro finished his second season as head coach of the Chicago Bulls with a 41–41 record, sufficient for the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. The Bulls lost the best of seven series in five games against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Bulls announced Del Negro's dismissal on May 4, 2010.[5] On July 6, 2010, multiple league sources confirmed that Del Negro would become the next head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers.[6] At the end of Del Negro's first season with the Clippers, the Clippers finished with a record of 32–50, missing the playoffs. Despite missing the playoffs, the Clippers did have the NBA Rookie of the Year, Blake Griffin.[7] Del Negro and Clippers followed up this mediocre season by acquiring All-Star point guard Chris Paul and finishing fifth in the Western Conference with a record of 40–26, one game shy of the division leading Los Angeles Lakers. The Clippers advanced to the second round of the playoffs for only the second time since they moved to Los Angeles in 1984.[8] A year later, Del Negro led the Clippers to the best season in the franchise's 43-year history. The Clippers notched a franchise-record 17-game winning streak, including a perfect 16–0 mark in December.[9] They won a franchise-record 56 games, their first 50-win season ever, as well as their first Pacific Division title.[8][10] The title was clinched after defeating the Lakers on April 7, which also completed a season sweep of their crosstown rivals, 4–0. The franchise had not swept the Lakers since 1974–75, when the Clippers were the Buffalo Braves.[11] It was also the first time in 20 years since 1992–93 that the Clippers won the season series against the Lakers.[12] However, the Clippers lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Memphis Grizzlies, 4–2, after winning the first two games.[8] On May 21, 2013, it was announced that the Clippers would not renew Del Negro's contract after its expiration at the end of June.[13] At times during the season, he was criticized for his player rotations. Del Negro had a 128–102 regular-season record in three seasons with the club, and his .557 winning percentage was the highest in club history. He was only the second coach to leave the Clippers with a winning record.[a] However, much of the club's success was credited to Paul and Griffin.[8] According to Yahoo! Sports and CBSSports.com, Paul, who was scheduled to become a free agent in the offseason, did not support Del Negro's return. Del Negro felt that Paul had ""a lot of say-so"" in the team's decisions, and Clippers owner Donald Sterling said he needed to be supportive of the team's star players.[14][15][16] Paul was upset that he was being blamed, and the Clippers later denied any player involvement in the coaching decision.[17] Del Negro is of Italian ancestry.[18] His father, Vince, played basketball at the University of Kentucky under legendary coach Adolph Rupp.[19]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/88.png

In 2019, Dischinger was inducted to the College Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2010, the 1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team of which Dischinger was a member, was collectively inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Dischinger practiced orthodontics after his NBA career. Dischinger attended James A. Garfield High School in Terra Haute, Indiana. The son of the football coach, Dischinger was a 3-year letter winner in basketball and was twice being named the Purple Eagles' MVP. During his senior season (1957–58), he was selected as captain and was the MVP of the 1958 Indiana All-Star team. Dischinger was also a 1958 Parade Magazine All-American.[1] During his high school career, Dischinger earned all-state honors in basketball, while being coached by Willard Kehrt, and in football and track, being coached by his father, Donas Dischinger.[2][3] As a high school freshman, he was a member of Terre Haute's 1955 Babe Ruth League world championship baseball team.[4] He was also a member of Garfield High's 1955 IHSAA Sectional Championship team; this was the deepest run Garfield would make during his high school career. City rival, Terre Haute Gerstmeyer Tech, was the main opposition to Garfield during Dischinger's career. Dischinger attended Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, where he played under Coach Ray Eddy in the Big Ten Conference.

On January 9, 1960, Dischinger pulled down 26 rebounds against Wisconsin, the second most in a game behind Carl McNulty's school record of 27 in 1951. Dishinger made the 1960 Olympic Team after his sophomore season. During his junior season (1960–1961), Purdue finished 16–7. Dischinger was named a First Team All-American[5] and led the conference in scoring with 28.2 points and 13.4 rebounds a game. On February 25, 1961--a number of online stories say ""Christmas Day in 1961"" but that is a mistake--Dischinger scored a career high 52 points against Michigan State on 19 field goals and 14 free throws. The 52 points broke Jerry Lucas's prior Big Ten Conference record of 48. In his next game, he made a single-game school record 21 free throws against Iowa on February 27, 1961.[citation needed][6][7] Purdue finished 17–7 in Dischinger's senior season.[8] In his last college game against Michigan on March 12, 1962, Dischinger played with a sprained ankle and scored 30 points. His 459 total points in his senior season led the conference in scoring for a third consecutive season. He was named a second straight First Team All-American while leading the Big Ten Conference in both scoring (30.3 points) and rebounding (13.4). He attempted a single-season Purdue record 350 free throws in his senior season.[citation needed][8][7] When he left Purdue, Dischinger held almost every Purdue scoring record. Many were later broken by the likes of Dave Schellhase and Rick Mount within that next decade. Dischinger was named All-Big Ten 3 consecutive seasons and selected as the Purdue MVP for each season. He currently holds school records for nine 40-plus-point games, 713 made free throws with 871 attempted, 14.3 rebounds a game and the second most in a career with 958 behind Joe Barry Carroll's 1,148 mark.[9] Dischinger averaged 28.3 points a game in his three varsity seasons, in which he led the conference in scoring each season. He's currently the sixth-highest scorer in Boilermaker history with a total of 1,979 points.[citation needed] Overall, Dischinger averaged a double-double of 28.3 points and 13.7 rebounds, shooting 55.3% from the floor and 81.9% from the line in 70 career games at Purdue.[7] Dischinger was selected to the USA men's basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics under head coach Pete Newell; at age 19, and just finishing his sophomore year of college, he was the youngest member of the team. As a starting guard/forward, he was teamed with future Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, and Jerry Lucas.[10] The team was named to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. He started all 8 games, scoring 90 total points, with an 11.3 points-per-game average as the fourth-leading scorer on the team.[11] ""It was a fairy tale because I played with my idol, Oscar Robertson. The experience made me a much better player."" said Dischinger.[12] Dischinger was the first pick of the second round (#8 overall) by the Chicago Zephyrs in the 1962 NBA draft.[5] Dischinger had an immediate impact in the NBA, as won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in the 1962–63 season, averaging 25.5 points, 8.0 rebounds and 3.1 assists in 57 games. The Zephyrs finished 25–55 under coaches Jack McMahon (12–26) and Slick Leonard (13–29).[5][13] ""During my rookie year I wanted to obtain my Chemical Engineering degree from Purdue, so Chicago let me attend school and play on weekends and holidays."" Dischinger recalled. ""One time after class I left Purdue at 4 PM, taped my ankles in a cab and played that night in San Francisco. It wasn't that tough of a year because I received my degree, the rookie of the year award, and was paid to play the game I loved.""[12] Dischinger was named rookie of the year over four future Hall of Famers, whom he joined on the 1962–63 NBA All-Rookie Team: Zelmo Beaty, Dave DeBusschere, John Havlicek and Chet Walker.[14] After his rookie season the Zephyrs moved to Baltimore, Maryland and became the Baltimore Bullets (today's Washington Wizards). In his second season, Dischinger averaged 20.8 points and 8.3 rebounds as Baltimore finished 31–49 under Hall of Fame Coach Leonard. Dischinger playing alongside future Hall of Famers Walt Bellamy and Rod Thorn, as well as Kevin Loughery, Gene Shue and Sihugo Green.[5][15][16] In his third season in the NBA, Dieschiger was traded to the Detroit Pistons. On June 18, 1964 Dischinger was traded by the Bullets with Don Kojis and Rod Thorn to the Pistons for Bob Ferry, Bailey Howell, Les Hunter, Wali Jones and Don Ohl. With Detroit, he averaged 18.2 points a game, and was chosen as an NBA All-Star for the third consecutive season.[5][16] Following his third NBA season, Dischinger left the NBA for military service. ""I was in the ROTC in college and was told I could fulfill my commission with the National Guard,"" said Dischinger. ""But I ended up serving for two years in Hawaii. It was really bad for my basketball career but it was there that I decided to practice dentistry when my playing days ended.""[12] He spent the next two years serving in the United States Army. There, he continued to play basketball, was named MVP for the Army all-Pacific team, served as a coach of the all-Army basketball team, and coached a State Department team on a tour of Central America in 1966.[3] After returning to the NBA in 1967, he returned to the Pistons, where he played for the next five seasons. During the 1971–72 season, he coached in two games as a player-coach at the age of 31. In six total seasons in Detroit, Dischinger averaged 12.2 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 452 games, playing alongside Hall of Famers Bob Lanier, Dave Bing and Walt Bellamy.[16][17][18] ""When you were winning it was great, and when you weren't it wasn't so great, but that's true anywhere, said Dischinger of his Pistons tenure. ""I played with a bunch of great players like Dave DeBusschere, Dave Bing, Bob Lanier, Tom Van Arsdale and Jimmy Walker. We had a special relationship and I loved my basketball life.""[12] July 31, 1972, Dischinger was traded by the Pistons to the Portland Trail Blazers for Fred Foster.[16] He averaged 6.1 points and 3.0 rebounds in 15 minutes per game for the 21–61 Blazers under Coach Jack McCloskey during the 1972–73 season.[19] Dischinger was involved in an altercation in 1973, with Mike Price of the Philadelphia 76ers. ""Dale Schlueter and LaRue Martin got into a fight, and I went over to help out and Price reacted,"" Dischinger recalled. ""It was a one-punch thing, and you know how those things are in sports. I had teeth loosened, but I didn't lose any. I thought I had a tooth in my mouth, but I felt in there, and it was chewing gum. I threw it away. I decided it was time to retire after that year,"" Dischinger said, jokingly, ""if that is the only thing you're remembered for, something is wrong.""[20] After his one season in Portland, he retired after nine seasons in the NBA. Overall, in his NBA career, Dischinger career averaged 13.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and had a .506 field goal percentage in 652 games.[5] Following his retirement from basketball in 1973, Dischinger completed dental school in Memphis, Tennessee. With his wife Mary, he returned to Portland, where he had ended his NBA career, to begin an orthodontic practice in the Portland suburb of Lake Oswego.[2][21][22] Dischinger and his wife Mary have been married more than fifty years and have three children and nine grandchildren. His grandson Michael Loomis played basketball at Northwest Christian University in Eugene, Oregon.[23] Dr. Terry Dischinger graduated from Purdue University with a BS in chemical engineering. He graduated from the University of Tennessee College of Dentistry in Nashville where he earned his DDS and was valedictorian of his class.[24]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/91.png
92,Billy Donovan,"May 30, 1965",,"Saint Agnes in Rockville Centre, New York",Providence,2016,2020,5,false,,"""[2]""",/coaches/donovbi99c.html,"William John Donovan Jr. (born May 30, 1965) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach for the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He previously spent 19 seasons at the University of Florida, where his Florida Gators teams won back-to-back NCAA championships in 2006 and 2007. Donovan has more wins than any other coach in the history of the Florida basketball program, and he coached the Gators to more NCAA tournament appearances, NCAA tournament wins, and Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships than all other Florida coaches combined. Donovan was born and raised in Rockville Centre on Long Island, New York. As the starting point guard for Rick Pitino's Providence team, Donovan led the Friars to the 1987 Final Four. As such, he is one of only four men (Dean Smith, Joe B. Hall and Bobby Knight being the others) to appear in the NCAA Final Four as a player and win the NCAA national championship as a coach.[1] After college, Donovan spent the 1987–88 and 1988–89 basketball seasons split between the developmental Continental Basketball Association and the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks, who were led by his college coach, Rick Pitino. Donovan left professional basketball in 1989, and briefly worked as a Wall Street stock broker before following Pitino to his new job at the University of Kentucky. Donovan served as an assistant coach for the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball from 1989 to 1993 under Pitino, working his way from serving as a graduate assistant to Pitino's top assistant. He accepted his first head coaching position at Marshall University in 1994 and led the Thundering Herd to a 35–20 record over two seasons. Donovan was hired to revive Florida's basketball program in 1996. After two losing seasons while he rebuilt the roster through relentless recruiting, Donovan's Gators began a streak of sixteen straight 20-win seasons, a period which included multiple conference championships, four Final Four appearances, two NCAA championships, and three SEC coach of the year awards. During Donovan's tenure at Florida, he was often rumored to be a candidate for various NCAA and NBA head coaching positions. In June 2007, after leading the Gators to their second consecutive national title, he accepted an offer to become the head coach of the NBA's Orlando Magic. However, he immediately had second thoughts, and after a week, he persuaded the Magic to release him from his newly signed contract and allow him to return to Florida, where he remained for eight more seasons.[2] In April 2015, Donovan agreed to become the head coach of the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder. In his first season with the team, Donovan led the Thunder to a first place finish in their division and a trip to the conference finals, where they lost to the Golden State Warriors in 7 games after building a 3–1 series lead. In subsequent seasons, the Thunder have finished with winning records and reached the NBA playoffs every year under Donovan but have not progressed past the first round. Donovan was born and raised in Rockville Centre on Long Island, New York along with a younger sister[3] by his parents, Bill Donovan Sr. and Joan Donovan. Bill Donovan Sr. is the third leading scorer in the history of the Boston College Eagles men's basketball program, and he sometimes coached his only son's youth basketball teams while working in the textile industry.[4] Billy Donovan Jr. attended St. Agnes Cathedral High School in Rockville Centre, where he played basketball under coach Frank Morris. Donovan was described as a ""gym rat"" who would play basketball as often as possible, even sneaking into his high school gymnasium late at night to practice.[5] With Donovan starting at point guard, St. Agnes won the Long Island Catholic High School Championship during his senior year.[6] Upon graduation, Donovan accepted an athletic scholarship to Providence College in Providence, Rhode Island. He was not a starter during his first two seasons with the Providence Friars men's basketball team and averaged two points per game as a freshman and three as a sophomore under coach Joe Mullaney. Mullaney retired after the 1984–85 season, and New York Knicks assistant coach Rick Pitino became Providence's new head coach. Soon after, Donovan informed Pitino that he would like to transfer to Fairfield or Northeastern to get more playing time. However, when Pitino called the coaches of those smaller conference schools on Donovan's behalf, they declined to offer him a scholarship, so Pitino advised Donovan to stay at Providence and get himself into better physical shape for the upcoming season.[7] Donovan flourished in Pitino's system, which emphasized the new three-point shot on offense and a fast-paced full-court press defense. ""Billy the Kid,"" as Providence fans soon nicknamed him (after the 19th century outlaw), averaged 15.1 points per game as a junior and 20.6 as a senior, when he led the sixth-seeded Friars to the 1987 Final Four and earned Southeast Regional Most Valuable Player honors. Donovan was also named to the 1987 All-Big East first team, the 1987 Big East All-Tournament team, and was an honorable mention All-American.[8] Pitino would later say, ""I've never in my life had anyone work as hard to improve as (Donovan).""[7] Donovan was drafted by the Utah Jazz in the third round (68th overall) of the 1987 NBA Draft, but was waived before the regular season began. He signed with the Wyoming Wildcatters of the Continental Basketball Association, hoping for another chance to play in the NBA. Rick Pitino left Providence after the team's Final Four run and returned to New York as the head coach of the New York Knicks. In December 1987, Donovan was reunited with his college coach when the Knicks signed him to a one-year contract.[9] He served as a reserve guard for the remainder of the 1987–88 season and averaged 2.4 points and 2.0 assists over 44 games. The Knicks waived Donovan in March 1988. He did not make an NBA roster during the 1988–89 preseason, so he returned to the CBA, averaging 10.1 points per game with the Rapid City Thrillers.[10][11] Donovan had not received another NBA offer by the end of 1988 and came to the conclusion that he did not have a long-term future as a professional basketball player. He left the CBA in January 1989 and took a job with a Wall Street investment banking firm. Donovan was ""miserable"" during his brief stint as a stock broker, and he especially hated the required cold-call stock sales.[12] After just a few weeks at the firm, he called Rick Pitino to seek advice about becoming a basketball coach. Donovan had not been a vocal leader as a player, and Pitino doubted if he had the necessary communication skills required for coaching, so he suggested that Donovan give the financial sector more of a chance before rushing to change careers.[13][14] Donovan called Pitino again in April 1989 to reaffirm his interest in coaching basketball. At the time, Pitino was in the process of leaving the Knicks to become the head coach at the University of Kentucky, and he agreed to bring along Donovan as a graduate assistant to see if he had a future in coaching.[15] Pitino was tasked with rebuilding a Kentucky basketball program which had been devastated by sanctions levied by the NCAA due to earlier rules violations. The Wildcats quickly returned to national prominence, and Donovan's coaching career progressed quickly as well. After one season as a graduate assistant, he was promoted to assistant coach in 1990 and to associate head coach in 1992. In that position, Donovan served as Pitino's top assistant during Kentucky's 1993 Final Four run, and he helped to recruit the members of UK's 1996 national championship team.[6] Donovan's association with Kentucky's success plus Pitino's recommendation earned him an offer to become the head basketball coach at Marshall University, where the Thundering Herd had struggled to a 9–18 record during the 1993–94 season. Donovan accepted the offer, making him (at 28 years old) the youngest head basketball coach in NCAA Division I.[16] At Marshall, Donovan installed the fast-paced offense and defensive schemes employed by Pitino. A previously scheduled early season match-up pitted Marshall against Kentucky in December 1994. Before the game, Pitino advised his young protege to ""try to whip Kentucky's ass, because we'll try to do the same to you.""[17] Though he was warmly received by the Rupp Arena crowd, Donovan's team did not feel as welcome, losing 116–75. The rest of the season was more successful. Donovan's first Marshall squad doubled its win total from the previous year, earning an 18–9 record and winning the Southern Conference North Division title as Donovan was named the 1995 Southern Conference Coach of the Year. In Donovan's second season, 1995–96, the team went 17–11 and led the Southern Conference in scoring and three-point field goals. Donovan was also successful on the recruiting trail, convincing nationally sought prep star Jason Williams to decline scholarship offers from more established programs and remain in state to attend Marshall. Williams would later follow Donovan to Florida. In all, Donovan's Marshall teams compiled a 35–20 record over two seasons. In March 1996, University of Florida basketball coach Lon Kruger resigned to take the same position at the University of Illinois. The Florida basketball program had only fleeting success over its history, and although the Gators reached their first Final Four under Kruger in 1994, his teams slipped back to mediocre levels. Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley sought a ""young, energetic, and enthusiastic"" coach to bring sustained success, and after a wide-ranging search, he decided that 30-year-old Billy Donovan was the best fit.[18] To assure Donovan that he would be given enough time to build up the program, Foley offered him a six-year contract.[19] With few talented players on the roster, Donovan's first two Florida squads had records of 13–17 and 15–16. There were some signs of improvement, however, as the 1997–98 team was invited to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), and Donovan's ""relentless"" recruiting during this period set the foundation for future success.[20] Donovan finally brought lasting success to the Florida basketball program during the 1998–99 season. The Gators went 22–9, earning 20+ wins for only the fifth time in history and starting a streak of 16 consecutive 20-win seasons. The Gators continued to play well in the 1999 postseason, as they made their third NCAA Sweet Sixteen appearance and became the second squad in school history to appear in the final top 25 polls (No. 17 in the ESPN/USA Today Poll and No. 23 in the Associated Press Poll). The 1999–2000 season saw Donovan lead the Gators to their first regular season SEC Championship and their second NCAA Final Four appearance, defeating North Carolina in the national semi-finals before falling to Michigan State in the NCAA championship game. The Gators again won the SEC regular season championship during the 2000–01 season, and on February 3, 2003, the team achieved a No. 1 ranking in the ESPN/USA Today poll for the first time in school history, returning there the following season on December 8, 2003. The 2004–05 season was highlighted by Florida defeating Kentucky 70–53 to win the SEC Tournament Championship, the first time that the Gators won the conference tournament. While successful during the regular season, Donovan's Florida squads from 2001 to 2005 consistently underperformed in the NCAA tournament, losing to lower-seeded teams in the first or second round every year despite rosters stocked with highly recruited players. Still in his thirties, some commentators speculated that Donovan was an excellent recruiter who was unable to make in-game adjustments or develop talented players once they were on the UF campus.[21][22] In the 2005–06 season, Donovan's sophomore-led Gator squad posted the school's best-ever win streak to start a season, reeling off 17 straight wins and reaching No. 2 in the nation in the AP Poll. However, the team failed to reach the top spot as they lost its first SEC game of the season to the Tennessee Volunteers. This loss was followed by a surprising season sweep at the hands of the eventual 2006 National Invitation Tournament champion South Carolina Gamecocks as Florida posted a 10–6 conference record, good for second place in the SEC Eastern Division. Donovan's young Gator squad would come together in the postseason. Florida reached the SEC Tournament championship and avenged their surprising regular season defeats by beating South Carolina in the finals, earning the school's second conference tournament title. In the 2006 NCAA tournament, the 3rd-seeded Gators finally reached the Sweet 16 and beyond. They defeated Villanova (who had knocked them out the tournament the previous season) to reach the Final Four, and in the championship game, they defeated UCLA 73–57 to win the school's first NCAA basketball title. During a post-championship celebration in the O'Connell Center, the Gators' entire starting five of (Lee Humphrey, Joakim Noah, Al Horford, Corey Brewer, and Taurean Green) announced they would return the following year and attempt to win another championship (the last back-to-back title winner was 1991 and 1992 Duke) instead of declaring early for the NBA draft. Accordingly, the Gators were named preseason favorites to repeat by many media pundits. The Gators raced out of the gates, losing just two non-conference games (vs. Kansas and at Florida State). On December 20, 2006, Donovan became the winningest basketball coach in Florida history, earning his 236th win to surpass Norm Sloan's total.[23] The 2007 Gators looked even more mature in terms of their unselfishness, passing and shooting abilities and overall team play. Although the Gators sputtered down the stretch during SEC play, losing three of four games beginning with a loss at Vanderbilt, the team rebounded with its sixth consecutive win over its archrivals, the Kentucky Wildcats, to regain momentum and claim the SEC regular season championship. The Gators then repeated as SEC Tournament champions with dominating performances that culminated in a win over the Arkansas Razorbacks in the finals. Florida earned the number one overall seed in the 2007 NCAA Tournament and defeated Jackson State, Purdue, Butler and Oregon to reach the Final Four.[24] The semi-final was a rematch of the 2006 title game against UCLA, and Donovan's Gators prevailed 76–66. The Gators secured their repeat championship two nights later with an emphatic 84–75 victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes, coached by Thad Matta. With the Florida Gators football having won the 2007 BCS National Championship Game (also over Ohio State) three months prior, the University of Florida became the first school in NCAA history to hold both the football and basketball national championships at the same time. Donovan's first decade in Gainesville brought a new level of success to the University of Florida's basketball program. The Gators were invited to the NCAA Tournament in every season between 1999 and 2007 (a streak of nine straight appearances), reached three national championship games, and won two NCAA titles. In contrast, Florida basketball squads had only appeared in five NCAA Tournaments in 81 years of play before Donovan's arrival and had never reached a NCAA championship game. In conference play, Florida had captured only one regular season SEC championship and had never won the conference tournament before Donovan's arrival. From 1996 until 2007, the Gators won three SEC regular season titles and three SEC tournament titles. After announcing his return to Gainesville, Donovan signed the top-ranked 2007 recruiting class, as rated by Rivals.com.[25] Despite the loss of all five starters from the previous year, the Gators surprised many pundits with Donovan's tenth straight twenty-win season.[26] However, after an 18–3 start, the team struggled during the final third of the season, winning just three of its last eleven games and snapping the Gators' nine-year streak of NCAA Tournament invitations. The young Gator team rebounded to reach the semifinals of the 2008 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) before falling to the UMass Minutemen. The 2008–09 Gators started out the season ranked No. 19 and 5–0 before falling to Syracuse. A loss two weeks later to the Florida State Seminoles knocked the Gators out of the top twenty-five ranked teams. Though the team won twenty-two regular season games, it once again was not enough to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. However, the Gators were given a number one seed in the 2009 NIT, where they lost to the Penn State Nittany Lions in the quarterfinals. The Gators returned to the NCAA tournament during the 2009–10 season, but lost in the first round to the BYU Cougars in double overtime. During the season, Florida defeated Florida State, ending a three-game losing streak to the Seminoles. They also defeated Michigan State, a preseason favorite to win the NCAA tournament and an eventual Final Four team, en route to winning the 2009 Legends Classic tournament. With three returning senior starters, the 2010–11 Gators posted an improved record. They won the SEC regular season title, and were the runners-up in the 2011 SEC Tournament. In the 2011 NCAA Tournament, the Gators defeated the Jimmer Fredette-led BYU Cougars, before losing in overtime to the Butler Bulldogs in the Elite Eight. On March 8, 2011, Donovan was named the 2011 SEC Coach of the Year.[27] Despite appearing in three national title games and winning two national titles, it was Donovan's first time winning the award. Gators forward Chandler Parsons also became the first Gator to ever win SEC Player of the Year honors. The 2011–12 Gators were again invited to the NCAA Tournament, this time as a seventh-seed. They defeated the tenth-seeded Virginia Cavaliers and fifteenth-seeded Norfolk State (who had beaten second-seeded Missouri) to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, then defeated Marquette 68–58 to return to the Elite Eight for the second straight year. In the Elite Eight, Donovan and the Gators faced off against Louisville and Donovan's former coach, Rick Pitino. The Gators fell in a very close game, 72–68. Donovan recorded his 400th career victory at the University of Florida on January 19, 2013 with an 83–52 win over the Missouri Tigers. The Gators won the 2013 SEC regular season championship (Donovan's fifth regular season conference championship), finished as runner-up in the 2013 SEC Tournament (losing to Ole Miss in the championship game), and advanced to a third consecutive Elite Eight (defeating Northwestern State in the second round, Minnesota in the third round, and Florida Gulf Coast in the Sweet Sixteen, before losing to Michigan in the regional final). Donovan's 2013–14 squad started the year with several players injured or suspended and faced one of the most challenging non-conference schedules in college basketball. Florida dropped two close road games to ranked teams and entered the conference portion of their schedule with an 11–2 record and a No. 10 national ranking. The Gators would not lose again during the regular season, becoming the first team in SEC history to finish with an 18–0 conference record while also setting numerous school records.[28] Florida then won the 2014 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament to run their overall record against SEC opponents to 21–0. The SEC regular season championship was the third in four seasons for Donovan's Gators, and their conference tournament championship was their fourth in school history, all coming under Donovan. He was named the SEC's Coach of the Year for the third time, and his players won many of the conference's individual awards. Senior point guard Scottie Wilbekin was named Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year and the SEC Tournament MVP, senior center Patric Young was named the Defensive Player and Scholar-Athlete of the Year, junior forward Dorian Finney-Smith was named Sixth Man of the Year, and senior guard Casey Prather was named to the All-SEC First Team.[29] The Gators earned the number one overall seed in the 2014 NCAA tournament, and their winning streak stretched to 30 games as they reached the Final Four by defeating each of their first four tournament opponents by double digit margins. However, the Gators' season ended with a national semifinal loss to the 7-seed and eventual national champion UConn Huskies, who had been the last team to beat Florida the previous December. On February 28, 2015, Donovan became the second youngest coach in NCAA Division I history to earn 500 career wins, accomplishing the feat in the Florida Gators' 66–49 victory over the Tennessee Volunteers. Donovan joined Bob Knight as the only coaches to reach 500 wins before turning 50 years old. However, his Gator squad finished the season with a 16–17 record, ending the Gators' winning season and 20-win season streaks at 16 years apiece. In 18 years at Florida, Donovan led the Gators to 14 NCAA Tournament appearances, six SEC regular season titles (four outright, two shared) and four SEC Tournament titles. By comparison, the Gators had only made three ""official"" NCAA Tournament appearances (not counting two under Sloan which were vacated), one regular season conference title, and no tournament titles in their entire history before Donovan's arrival. During Florida's national championship runs, rumors abounded that Donovan was considering an offer to become the head coach at the University of Kentucky. He later said that, while UK may have had some interest, he ""never had any official contact with Kentucky.""[30] After winning the 2007 national championship, Donovan announced that he had no plans to leave Florida for another college job and was working on a contract extension with UF. However, in late May, the NBA's Orlando Magic offered Donovan their head coaching job to replace Brian Hill, who has been fired after two consecutive losing seasons. Donovan struggled with the decision until June 1, when he agreed to accept the Magic's contract offer, which was reportedly worth $27.5 million over five years.[31] Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley contacted Anthony Grant, Donovan's former assistant who was the head coach at Virginia Commonwealth University at the time, to inquire about his interest in replacing Donovan at Florida.[32] Donovan held an introductory press conference in Orlando on June 1 followed by an emotional farewell press conference in Gainesville later the same day. On the morning of June 2, 2007, Donovan began having second thoughts about his decision, and he soon informed Jeremy Foley and the Magic front office that he had changed his mind about leaving Florida.[33] After failing to change his mind back, the Magic came to an agreement with Donovan to release him from his contract on June 7, leaving him free to rejoin the Gators basketball team. As a stipulation of his release, he reportedly agreed not to coach in the NBA for the following five seasons.[34][35] Donovan issued apologies to all parties involved, and the Magic soon hired Stan Van Gundy instead.[36] On April 30, 2015, Donovan was named the head coach of the Oklahoma City Thunder, reportedly agreeing to a five-year deal,[37][38] replacing Scott Brooks who previously coached the Thunder for seven seasons.[39] Donovan has been chosen to be a head coach for USA Basketball on three occasions. He coached the 2012 U18 team to the 2012 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship, going 5–0 in the tournament. He then led many of the same players to the 2013 FIBA Under-19 World Championship, going 9–0 in that tournament. The following summer, he again coached the US team at the 2014 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship and again led them to the tournament championship with another 5–0 record.[40] Some commentators have opined that Donovan should succeed Mike Krzyzewski as the head coach of the United States men's national basketball team at the 2020 Summer Olympics.[41] The United States Sports Academy presented Donovan with the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award in 2006.[42][43] Donovan was the recipient of the John R. Wooden Award's ""Legends of Coaching Award"" in 2010. Donovan was recognized by his peers as the SEC Coach of the Year in 2011, 2013 and 2014. Donovan married his wife, Christine (née D'Auria), in 1989.[44] The Donovans have four children: Connor, Bryan, Hasbrouck and William Donovan III, who transferred to Florida from Catholic University and walked on to his father's team as a reserve guard.[45] A fifth child, Jacqueline, was delivered stillborn in 2000, prompting Donovan to become involved in several children's charities and to help raise funds for a children's hospital in Gainesville.[13] Similar tragedies struck the families of Donovan's mentor Rick Pitino, former assistant coach Anthony Grant, and current assistant John Pelphrey, forging a closer bond between them.[46] Donovan's parents bought a home in Gainesville in 1996, and Bill Donovan Sr., has been a fixture at most Gator games and practices ever since.[47] Donovan is a Roman Catholic. He has been described as politically conservative by some of his players and in the media;[48] however, he is a registered independent.[49] In October 2008, coach Donovan and then-head Florida Gators football coach Urban Meyer were named co-chairmen of an effort to raise $50 million to support the Florida Opportunity Scholars Program.[50][51] The Florida Opportunity Scholars Program was created by University of Florida President Bernie Machen in 2006, and is intended to increase the opportunities for academically prepared first-generation students who have experience significantly different needs and financial challenges.[52][53] Donovan was instrumental in fund-raising and pushing for the development of a Catholic high school in Gainesville, which did not have a Catholic secondary school when Donovan arrived at the University of Florida in 1996.

He was most recently the head coach of the Tulane University men's basketball team. Dunleavy is the father of former professional basketball player Mike Dunleavy Jr. Dunleavy was born in Brooklyn, New York. His primary education was at Holy Cross. He attended Nazareth Regional High School in Brooklyn, then graduated from the University of South Carolina, where he played under coach Frank McGuire. Drafted in the sixth round of the 1976 NBA Draft with the 99th overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers, the 6'3"" guard played for them for one full season along with Hall-of-Fame teammate Julius Erving and made the Finals in a losing effort against the Portland Trail Blazers. Dunleavy then split the following season between Philadelphia and the Houston Rockets after being traded, and soon made the Finals once again, but yet again his team lost, this time to the Boston Celtics, led by Larry Bird. Dunleavy remained in Texas after leaving Houston for the 1982–83 season, because he spent that season with the neighboring San Antonio Spurs. After two following seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks he retired due to chronic back pain. His best season as a player was with Houston in 1980–81, when he averaged 10.5 points per game and started on a team that played in the NBA Finals. During his retirement, Dunleavy worked in an investment firm. In 1988–89 and 1989–90, while an assistant coach with the Bucks, he helped as a player for two and five games respectively. In 438 games he averaged 8 points, 1.6 rebounds and 3.9 assists. He entered his first head coaching job in 1990 as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, replacing Pat Riley. In 1991 his team, led by Magic Johnson and Vlade Divac, beat the Portland Trail Blazers in the Western Conference Finals and he led his team to the NBA Finals against the Chicago Bulls but they lost in five games. He made the playoffs in his second season in Los Angeles, but lost in the first round. He then joined the Milwaukee Bucks as head coach prior to the 1992–93 season and remained with them until the end of the 1995–96 season, in a dual role as vice-president of basketball operations and head coach. He relinquished his head coaching duties after a mediocre tenure to operate as the general manager, until accepting the job of head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers in 1997. Dunleavy was named NBA Coach of the Year in 1999 while with the Blazers. He remained in Portland until the end of the 2000–01 season, when he was fired. He made the playoffs four times with the team. He joined the Clippers in 2003. Dunleavy led the Clippers to the second round of the playoffs, their first playoff berth since 1997, and to the franchise's first series win since a 1977 first-round victory while the team was still playing in Buffalo. The Clippers finished 40–42 in 2006–07, out of the playoffs after a season-ending slump brought on by injury. He also worked for TNT in 2008, calling NBA playoff games.

He was also a sports broadcaster. Eckman was born in Baltimore, Maryland and graduated from the Baltimore City College high school in 1940. Eckman was a three-sport star as a youngster, excelling in baseball, basketball and track. His father, who was gassed in World War I, died when Charlie was 12 years old; after that he and his mother struggled to make ends meet.[1] Among the odd jobs Eckman did to raise extra money, he officiated basketball games. Baseball was Eckman's primary sport, however, in those days, it was the only professional team sport of any note. He was drafted by the Washington Senators after graduating from Baltimore City College and played in their farm system, but never made it to the majors.[2] Eckman's career got sidetracked for two years when he enlisted in the US Army Air Corps in late 1943, but he continued to keep his eyes in shape by refereeing the Reserve intramural basketball games. Upon his discharge in 1945, Eckman moved his wife and newborn son to Arizona, where he had been stationed. He continued to officiate basketball games, this time with the American League West Coast, while working for the Phoenix office of the War Assets Administration. The American Basketball League's Hollywood Shamrocks called in 1947 and hired him to officiate a number of the team's games; two years after that he began refereeing games for the Basketball Association of America. The BAA merged with the National Basketball League in late 1949 and became the National Basketball Association. Eckman was ranked as one of the top officials in the NBA during his time as a referee, until 1954, when Pistons owner Fred Zollner signed the 32-year-old Eckman to a three-year coaching contract. Eckman officiated at the first NBA All-Star Game in 1951, and later was the head coach of the Western Conference All-Star teams in 1955, and 1956, becoming the only person to have officiated and coached in an NBA All-Star Game.[3] In 1967, after 29 years and over 3,500 collegiate and professional basketball games, Eckman, announced his retirement from officiating, after experiencing leg problems. Eckman is the only person to have ever officiated the NIT, NCAA and NBA Finals games.[4] During his first year as head coach, the Pistons finished with a 43–29 record, and first place in the Western Division. During the 1955 NBA Finals, the Pistons lost a hard-fought seven-game to the Syracuse Nationals. The first-year head coach was honored as NBA Coach of the Year. The following season, Eckman lead the Pistons to another trip to the NBA Finals, where the Pistons fell to the Philadelphia Warriors, 4–1. In his third season as head coach, Eckman lead the Pistons to the playoffs, where they lost to the Minneapolis Lakers in the semifinals. During the 1957–58 season, the Pistons relocated from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Detroit, Michigan. Unfortunately for Eckman, his stay in Detroit didn't last long. He was relieved of his coaching duties just 25 games into the season following a 9–16 start. Eckman's overall coaching record was 123–118. He eventually returned to officiating.[5] Eckman began working as a sportscaster on the radio in 1961 with ""The voice of the Chesapeake Bay."" Later in 1965, Charley accepted a position as sportscaster for WCBM and WFBR. Eckman became an award-winning radio sportscaster, handling color commentary for the Baltimore Bullets, Orioles and Colts. On July 3, 1995, Eckman died of colon cancer, at the age of 73.[6]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/98.png

He also played for the Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, Oklahoma City Thunder, and Dallas Mavericks. He has also served as president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA). Fisher played college basketball for the Arkansas–Little Rock Trojans, earning the Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year in 1996. Selected by the Lakers with the 24th pick in the 1996 NBA draft, he spent his first eight seasons with the franchise, winning three consecutive league championships (2000–2002) with teammates Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal and coach Phil Jackson. After the 2003–04 NBA season, he signed as a free agent with the Golden State Warriors, later being traded to the Utah Jazz, whom he helped lead to the Western Conference finals. Due to his daughter's health, he asked to be released from his contract in 2007. He rejoined the Lakers and won two more NBA titles with Bryant and Jackson. In 2012, he was traded to the Houston Rockets, where he bought out his contract and was waived at his request. He then joined the Oklahoma City Thunder for the remainder of the season, playing for the 2012 NBA championship in his eighth Finals appearance. After signing with the 2012–13 Dallas Mavericks he played only nine games before being injured and asking to be released from his contract. He later rejoined the Oklahoma City Thunder for another late season push. He re-signed with them in the off-season and played in a team-high 81 regular-season games for the team in 2013–14.[1] The following season, he was hired as the head coach of the New York Knicks by Jackson, who had become the team's president. He was fired in 2016, and has since been featured as a broadcast television analyst on Turner Sports' NBA programming.[2] Fisher also joined Spectrum SportsNet for the 2016-17 NBA season to work as an in-studio analyst for the Los Angeles Lakers.[3] On January 19, 2017, Fisher was announced as one of the analysts for Turner Sports' new Players Only programming slate.[4] Fisher is the all-time NBA record holder in playoff games played. While playing for the Lakers, he hit a buzzer beater with 0.4 second left in game 5 of the 2004 Western Conference Semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs, which the NBA lists as the 18th-greatest playoff moment of all time.[5] Derek Fisher was born in Little Rock, Arkansas. He attended Parkview Arts and Science Magnet High School in Little Rock, where he was a letterman in basketball. He went on to attend the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR) for four years, with a major in communications. Fisher concluded his collegiate career at Arkansas-Little Rock second on the school's all-time lists in points (1,393), assists (472), and steals (189). He averaged 12.4 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.2 assists over 112 games and led the team in assists and steals every year. Fisher also set a school record for free throws made in a career (399) and ranked third among all-time UALR leaders in three-point field goals made (125). As a senior, he earned Sunbelt Conference Player of the Year honors after averaging 14.5 points, 5.2 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game.[6][7] In 2005, Fisher pledged $700,000 to UALR towards the construction of its Jack Stephens Center auxiliary gym, since named in his honor, and the establishment of the Fisher Fellows Life Skills program, a mentoring series for UALR student-athletes.[8] Fisher was selected 24th overall in the 1996 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers, and spent his first eight seasons with them.[6] He made his NBA debut in an early season game against the Phoenix Suns, tallying 12 points and five assists. Over the course of his rookie season, Fisher appeared in 80 games, averaging 3.9 points, 1.5 assists, and 1.2 rebounds. He was selected to the Schick Rookie Game during the All-Star Weekend in Cleveland and had 16 points and six assists. In the 1997–98 season, Fisher started 36 of 82 games, backing up Nick Van Exel. He started all 13 games in the playoffs and averaged 6 points per game as the Lakers advanced to the Western Conference Finals before losing to the Utah Jazz in 4 games. In the lockout-shortened 1998–1999 season, Fisher played in all 50 games and started in 21, mostly serving as a backup for veteran Derek Harper. Fisher would once again start in all of the Lakers' playoff games, posting averages of 9.8 points and 4.9 assists per game as the Lakers advanced past the Houston Rockets in the first round before falling to the San Antonio Spurs in the second round in 4 games. Phil Jackson became the Lakers' head coach prior to the 1999–2000 season, and with him brought veteran point guard Ron Harper, who had started for three of Jackson's Chicago Bulls championship teams. Jackson historically preferred big guards. Being both smaller and playing more like a traditional point guard, and not being much of a shooter, Fisher worked hard on his shooting during the offseason to increase his value to the new coach.[9][10] He started in 22 of 78 games for the season, backing up both Harper and Kobe Bryant when injured. The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the Indiana Pacers in 6 games to win the 2000 NBA championship, Fisher's first. Due to a stress fracture in his right foot, Fisher missed the first 62 games of the 2000–01 season. During his absence, the Lakers were not winning as frequently as the previous season, which led to teammates Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal rekindling their feud over the team's offense. Assistant coach Bill Bertka, however, believed a key factor in the team's struggles was the team's defense without Fisher.[11][12] Fisher returned on March 13, 2001, upgrading the Lakers' defense, and he started the final 20 games of the season, averaging 11.5 points per game. Harper had been the regular starter, but he was sidelined since February 13 with injuries to both knees.[13] The Lakers finished the regular season with an eight-game winning streak, and ended with 56 wins.[14] Fisher started all of the Lakers 16 playoff games as they swept through the Western Conference, averaging 13.4 points per game and shooting a team best 51 percent from beyond the three-point line. This included a career-high 28 points on 6 for 7 three-point shooting in Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. In the Finals, the Lakers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in 5 games, bolstered by Fisher's 18 points on 6 of 8 shooting from three-point range in game 5 to help clinch the Laker's second straight title. Injuries limited Fisher to start in 35 of 70 games in the 2001–02 season, but he continued to average double figure scoring and shot over 40 percent from three-point range for the season. Fisher started all 19 playoff games, averaging 10.2 points per game as the Lakers advanced to the finals following a grueling 7 games series against the Sacramento Kings. In the finals, they defeated the New Jersey Nets to win their third straight title. By the 2002–03 season, Fisher had established himself as the Lakers' primary point guard, starting in all 82 games. But the team was eliminated in the Western Conference Semifinals by the eventual champion Spurs that spring, and this was followed by the signing of veteran point guard Gary Payton in the summer. As a result, Fisher was demoted back to the bench for the 2003–04 season. During NBA All-Star Weekend, he was a member of the Los Angeles team that won the Shooting Stars Competition.[15] One of Fisher's finest playoff moments came on May 13, 2004, in Game 5 of the 2004 Western Conference Semifinals between the Lakers and the defending champion San Antonio Spurs. The series was tied at 2, and Game 5 was a closely contested affair. With 11 seconds remaining, Kobe Bryant hit a jump shot to put the Lakers up 72–71. Tim Duncan then made a fadeaway 18-footer over Shaquille O'Neal to give the Spurs a 73–72 lead with 0.4 seconds on the clock. To devise strategies, three consecutive time-outs were called: the first by the Lakers, the second by San Antonio to set up the defense, and the last by the Lakers to re-set up the offense. When the game resumed, Gary Payton inbounded the ball to Fisher, who managed to catch, turn, and shoot the game-winning basket all in 0.4 seconds. Fisher sprinted off the court, as he later admitted he was uncertain he beat the buzzer and wanted to exit before the play could be reviewed. The Spurs immediately filed a dispute regarding the shot and after reviewing video footage of the play, the referees concluded that the ball indeed left Fisher's hands before the clock expired. The ""0.4"" shot counted and the Lakers won the game by a score of 74–73.[16] The Lakers closed out the Spurs in Game 6. They proceeded to defeat the Minnesota Timberwolves to clinch the Western Conference championship, but were upset in the NBA Finals by the Detroit Pistons. On July 15, 2004, Fisher signed a six-year, $37 million contract with the Golden State Warriors.[17] Fisher's two-season term with Golden State proved to be somewhat of a disappointment. While he was a reliable spot-up shooter, Fisher saw limited openings without a star player such as Bryant or O'Neal to command a double-team. The team as a whole continued to struggle mightily and languished near the bottom of the Western Conference standings. Speedy Claxton started more games than Fisher in the 2004–05 season, and then newly acquired point guard Baron Davis was a starter the following season. Despite this, in 2005–06 season, Fisher averaged 13.3 points a game, the highest season scoring average of his career. Fisher was acquired by the Utah Jazz on July 12, 2006, in a trade that sent Keith McLeod, Andre Owens, and Devin Brown to the Golden State Warriors. He appeared in all 82 games of the 2006–07 season, averaging 10.1 points, 3.3 assists, and 1.01 steals while scoring in double figures 40 times in the 2006–07 season. In November 2006, Fisher was voted President of the National Basketball Players Association, succeeding Antonio Davis. Fisher had previously served as vice president.[18] He has also been the color commentator for the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA since July 1, 2008. Several days before the Western Conference Semifinals between the Jazz and the Golden State Warriors began, Fisher stated that one of his four children was ill, avoiding going into further detail other than to say he needed to be with his family and his playing status was uncertain. Fisher had asked head coach Jerry Sloan to leave him on the active list for Game 2, but could not guarantee he would make it in time to play. But with permission from their doctors, he and his family flew from New York after his daughter's surgery and landed in Salt Lake City with the game in progress. When they landed, Fisher found out starting point guard Deron Williams was in foul trouble and his backup Dee Brown had been injured. The Jazz had been using Andrei Kirilenko as a point guard and desperately needed Fisher. Given a police escort, Fisher arrived at the arena, suited up, and was given a standing ovation as he walked onto the floor. Not even given a chance to sit down, Fisher was put in the game in the middle of the third quarter. Late in the fourth, Fisher made a key defensive stop on Baron Davis that helped send the game into overtime. In the closing minutes, the Jazz held a three-point lead when Deron Williams found an open Fisher for a three-pointer that sealed the victory.[19] After the game, a tearful Fisher was interviewed, where he revealed the situation involving his then-11-month-old daughter, Tatum. She had been diagnosed with retinoblastoma, a degenerative and rare form of eye cancer, which required an emergency three-hour surgery and chemotherapy at a New York hospital.[20] The Jazz eventually defeated the Warriors 4 games to 1, but fell to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals in five games. Fisher's dramatic Game 2 entrance and performance against the Warriors was nominated for Best Moment in the 2007 ESPY Awards. On July 2, 2007, Fisher asked the Jazz to release him from his contract so he could relocate to a team and city that would have the ""right combination"" of specialists that could help fight his daughter's retinoblastoma.[21][22] The Jazz honored his request.[22][23] After much speculation, on July 19, 2007, Fisher officially rejoined the Los Angeles Lakers by signing a three-year contract worth roughly $14 million.[22][23] He had given up roughly $8 million over three years, as he was due about $22 million over the next three years in his prior contract with the Jazz. Jazz owner Larry Miller noted that ""[i]t did look funny"" that Fisher signed with the Lakers, but he did not believe Fisher or Lakers owner Jerry Buss would do anything underhanded.[24] Jazz fans have taunted him, suspecting that he simply wanted to return to the Lakers.[25] When the 2007–08 season began, Fisher resumed his role as the Lakers' starting point guard. He contributed a solid season, shooting 40% from the three-point range and 88% from the free throw line, the highest percentage of his career. He made a controversial defensive play in Game 4 of the Lakers-Spurs Western Conference Finals, when late in the game Fisher jumped into Brent Barry's path without a foul called, causing Barry to miss a potential game winning shot. The Lakers eventually ousted the Spurs 4–1, but lost the NBA Finals to Boston. Throughout the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Fisher faced criticism about his age and lackluster defensive performances against younger, quicker opposing point guards. However, Fisher helped the Lakers win Game 4 over the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals, hitting a three-pointer over Jameer Nelson with 4.6 seconds remaining to send the game into overtime, and a tie-breaking three-pointer with 31.3 seconds remaining in overtime to help send the Lakers to a 3–1 series lead and soon after, the franchise's 15th NBA title. Bill Plaschke of the Los Angeles Times described these shots by stating, ""After his two jaw-flooring three-pointers led the Lakers to a 99–91 overtime victory against the Orlando Magic in Game 4 of the NBA Finals, you'll now officially be seeing him forever.""[26] Fisher's 11.0 points per game, 50% shooting average, and 44% three-point percentage over the course of the Finals were an improvement over his regular season numbers and a departure from his post-season struggles to that point. He had shot 23.5% from behind the three-point line and 35.6% from the field in the three prior playoff series. This was Fisher's fourth NBA championship. On September 8, 2009, Fisher released a book, Character Driven: Life, Lessons, and Basketball.[27] He is credited as the author of the book with Gary Brozek contributing. On February 3, 2010, Fisher made the 1,000th 3-pointer of his career against the Charlotte Bobcats.[28] On February 10, 2010, Fisher played his 1,000th career game against his former team, the Utah Jazz, beating Kobe Bryant to the milestone by one game.[29] On February 23, 2010, Fisher made the 9,000th point of his NBA career against the Memphis Grizzlies. On June 8, 2010, in Game 3 of the NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics, Fisher played a pivotal role down the stretch to help the Lakers take a 2–1 series lead. In the 4th quarter, he scored 11 of his 16 points, including a 3-point-play lay-up that helped the Lakers wrap up a 91–84 road victory.[30] In Game 7, the Lakers came all the way back from a 13-point 3rd-quarter deficit when Fisher hit a critical 3-pointer to tie the game with 6:11 remaining. The Lakers ultimately defeated the Celtics 83–79, and Fisher went on to win his fifth NBA championship. After his fifth championship win, Fisher became a free agent, fielding offers from several teams, including the Miami Heat. However, on July 12, 2010, he agreed to a three-year, $10.5 million deal with a player option in the third year to continue with the Lakers. Though their contract offer was not the most lucrative, Fisher considered it ""the most valuable"" option.[31][32] On March 15, 2012, Fisher was traded along with a 2012 first round draft pick to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill.[33] The Lakers had decided to go younger, acquiring point guard Ramon Sessions earlier in the day.[34] On March 19, he was waived by the Rockets without ever playing for them after he negotiated a contract buyout. After clearing waivers, he was eligible to sign with any team except the Lakers.[34][35][36] On March 21, 2012, after clearing the waivers at 6 pm Eastern time, Fisher signed a contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder for the remainder of the 2011–2012 season.[37] The Thunder organization called a pre-game press conference prior to its 7pm game to formally announce the signing.[38] He chose jersey number 37, his age at the time, because his usual No. 2 was taken by Thabo Sefolosha.[39] He made his debut on that night against the Los Angeles Clippers, scoring 5 points. The Thunder defeated the Spurs in the Western Conference finals and advanced to the 2012 NBA Finals, Fisher's eighth career appearance there. The Thunder would go on to lose the series in 5 games to the Miami Heat. On November 29, 2012, Fisher signed with the Dallas Mavericks.[40] The team was in need of a point guard after a finger injury sidelined struggling starter Darren Collison.[41][42] He wore No. 6, signifying his quest for a sixth championship,[43] as his usual No. 2—last worn in Dallas by Jason Kidd—was unavailable.[44] Fisher started in his first game with the Mavericks and Collison came off the bench in a 92–77 win over Detroit.[45] On December 20, Fisher injured the patellar tendon of his right knee, requiring an estimated two-week recovery time. Two days later, the Mavericks granted his request to be released. He said the move was driven by the injury and a desire to be close to his family. In nine games with Dallas, the team went 5–4, and he averaged 8.6 points and 3.6 assists in just over 25 minutes per game.[43][46] On February 25, 2013, Fisher re-signed with Oklahoma City for the remainder of the 2012–13 season.[47] He filled the Thunder's opening for a third point guard after Eric Maynor had been traded.[48] After being away from basketball, Fisher reflected on his career and decided to pursue the opportunity with the Thunder.[49] He did not contact Dallas before signing with the championship contenders, which upset Mavericks officials.[43][49][50] Fisher chose to wear No. 6 with Oklahoma City after wearing No. 37 the previous season.[43] On July 24, 2013, Fisher re-signed with the Thunder for the 2013–14 season.[51] He played in 81 regular-season games and all 19 playoff games.[52][53] On June 10, 2014, Fisher was hired by the New York Knicks to be the team's head coach, signing a five-year, $25 million deal. Fisher said his relationship with Jackson, who had become the president of the Knicks, was a major factor in his decision to join the team.[54][55] Fisher planned for the Knicks to run the triangle offense, which he learned while with the Lakers under Jackson. During the offseason, he helped the Knicks re-recruit and re-sign free agent Carmelo Anthony, whom Fisher believed could adapt to the new offense. On October 29, Fisher made his coaching debut where the team lost their 2014–15 season opener to the Chicago Bulls 104–80. On October 30, Fisher won his first game as a head coach after the Knicks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 95–90.[56] The Knicks ended the season with a 17–65 record, the worst in franchise history.[57] Bolstered by first-round draft pick Kristaps Porziņģis, New York began 2015–16 as playoff contenders with a 22–22 record.[57] However, Fisher was fired on February 8, 2016, after the Knicks lost nine of their next 10 and fell to a 23–31 record. Over one and a half seasons with the Knicks, he compiled an overall record of 40–96 (.294).[57][58] On December 5, 2018, Fisher was named the head coach of the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA.[59] The team got its first win of the 2019 season on June 1, 2019, defeating the Connecticut Sun 77-70, giving Fisher his first win as a WNBA head coach.[60] On September 4, 2019, Fisher became the ninth WNBA head coach to achieve 20 wins in their rookie season, as the team defeat the Atlanta Dream 70-60.[61] The team would finished 22-12 under Fisher's first season, making the WNBA playoffs as the third seed. Under the playoff format, the team would bypass the first round and face off against the Seattle Storm in a single-elimination game, beating the Storm 92-69 to advance the WNBA semi-finals. In the third semifinal game against the Connecticut Sun, Fisher came up with a strategy that Vox Media called bizarre, benching his three starting stars, Candace Parker, Nneka Ogwumike, and Chelsea Gray, for the fourth quarter, after which the Sparks were eliminated.[62] Fisher made guest appearances on television broadcasts throughout his career, and he began working professionally as a broadcaster in the spring of 2016. Multiple times during the NBA season, Fisher appeared as an analyst on TNT's Inside the NBA, and NBA TV.[63] At the start of the 2016-17 NBA season, Fisher joined Spectrum SportsNet as an in-studio analyst for the Los Angeles Lakers.[64] Fisher had a long and successful career in the NBA, especially with the Lakers. Fisher was perhaps best known for his leadership, toughness, and clutch playmaking ability. He averaged 8.3 points per game for his career and never topped more than 13.3 points during a regular season. However, he did shoot at least 40% from the 3pt line four times and 90% from the free throw line three times in the regular season throughout his career. At the time of his retirement as a player after the 2013–14 season, Fisher held NBA career playoff records of 259 games played and 161 games won. He was also ranked third in career three-point field goals in the NBA Finals.[55] Phil Jackson said that Fisher was ""definitely the spokesman for [the Lakers] as far as leadership goes"",[65] while Bryant called him his favorite teammate.[66] In a 2011 poll of NBA players by Sports Illustrated, Fisher received the fourth most votes, six percent, for being the best flopper in the game. ""Fish takes the contact. He does draw and sell offensive fouls,"" Jackson said. ""We're happy he does what he does.""[67] Fisher was a player representative for the NBPA before becoming a member of the union's executive committee. He was elected the union's president in 2006. He supported the NBA's referees during their lockout in 2009. During the 2011 NBA lockout, Fisher took a more active role than his predecessors, and he shared the lead with Billy Hunter, the union's full-time executive director.[68] Jason Whitlock of Foxsports.com wrote that Fisher was privately working with Stern on a deal to accept a lower percentage of revenues for the players and that Hunter confronted Fisher about the issue.[69] In a letter to the players, Fisher called the reports questioning his loyalty ""absurd"" and demanded ""a retraction for the libelous and defamatory stories"" through his attorneys.[70][71] Hunter said, ""My relationship with Derek is very good. There was no confrontation.""[71][72] Hunter later persuaded the union's executive committee to vote to request Fisher's resignation. Fisher did not resign and pushed for an outside investigation of the union. Hunter's leadership was criticized in the findings. During their annual meeting over the All-Star break in 2013, the union unanimously voted Hunter out as executive director.[73] Fisher was re-elected as president; he was not on an NBA roster at the time, but remained eligible due to his stint earlier in the season with Dallas.[73][74] Fisher's term as president expired in summer 2013.[75] In May 2013, Hunter sued Fisher and Jamie Wior, Fisher's publicist and business partner, seeking compensation and punitive damages.[76] The suit claimed that Fisher had a secret deal with NBA owners during the lockout.[77] In January 2014, a judge dismissed all of Hunter's claims against Wior and Fisher,[78][79] and Hunter dropped his subsequent appeal in May.[80] Fisher is the younger brother of former NBA player Duane Washington, who is ten years Fisher's senior.[81] Fisher is a Christian who has spoken about his faith and the ability he believes it gives him to play basketball.[82] Fisher's nickname is D-Fish, which he acquired while playing with the Los Angeles Lakers.[citation needed] He married his wife, Candace, on February 19, 2005,[83] and has four children: Tatum and Drew (twins), Marshall and Chloe.[84] On March 18, 2015, Fisher filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences;[85] the divorce was finalized in May 2016.[86] In 2009, Fisher had a temporary restraining order placed on a 40-year-old female stalker who had been victimizing him since 2001.[87] She had insisted she and Fisher were married, and had even changed her surname to match his.[88] He had the order extended by three years, expiring in May 2012.[88] Fisher competed on season 25 of Dancing with the Stars, partnered with professional dancer Sharna Burgess.[89] They were the third couple to be eliminated. In October 2015, Fisher was involved in a physical altercation with former teammate Matt Barnes at a party in the home of Barnes' ex-wife, Gloria Govan.[90] Fisher and Govan became engaged in April 2018.[91] Fisher was arrested on suspicion of DUI on June 4, 2017, after a car crash in Los Angeles in which his vehicle overturned. Govan, who was a passenger, was uninjured.[92] He later pleaded no contest in the case.[93]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/103.png
104,Bill Fitch,"May 19, 1934",,"Cedar Rapids in Cedar Rapids, Iowa",Coe College,1971,1998,25,true,,"""[6, 2, 1, 3, 1]""",/coaches/fitchbi99c.html,"William Charles Fitch (born May 19, 1932)[1] is an American former National Basketball Association (NBA) coach who had been successful in developing a number of teams into playoff contenders. Before entering the professional ranks, he coached college basketball at the University of Minnesota, Bowling Green State University, the University of North Dakota, and his alma mater, Coe College. Fitch's teams twice qualified for the NCAA tournament. He won the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award for the 2012–13 NBA season.[2] Fitch was a United States Marine Corps drill instructor,[3] a fact that Larry Bird credited in his book Drive: The Story of My Life as an important reason for Bird's own strong work ethic. Bill Fitch was elected to the National Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019. Fitch coached at four universities, the University of Minnesota, Bowling Green State University, the University of North Dakota, and his alma mater, Coe College. He led North Dakota to three NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Tournaments and he led Bowling Green to the 1968 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament in his only season with the team after winning the Mid-American Conference title with an 18–7 record and 10–2 in conference play. At Minnesota, he coached the Golden Gophers to 12–12 and 13–11 in his two seasons there.[4] During his 25-year pro coaching career, Fitch was often hired in an attempt to improve failing teams. Although Fitch currently ranks tenth among NBA coaches in all-time number of victories (with 944), he is also ranked second in all-time losses (with 1,106) behind Lenny Wilkens. In 1996 Fitch was named one of the NBA's Ten Greatest Coaches of All-Time. In 2016, Fitch was honored with an honorary bench by the Hall of Fame, which surrounds a statue of James Naismith along with other granite benches in honor of great coaches, done so by a $150,000 donation by Rick Carlisle.[5] Fitch was hired by the Cleveland Cavaliers as coach on March 19, 1970 for the 1970–71 season, the inaugural season for the team. In his first season, the Cavaliers went 15–67. The Cavaliers did not have a season as bad as that one until the 1981–82 season, which also garnered 15 wins. The team gradually rose in wins for the next two years, winning 32 in his third season, although they slipped slightly the following year. In his first four years, they finished last each time in the Central Division. His fifth season (1974–75) resulted in marked improvement as the Cavs won 40 games while finishing third, their first season without a last place finish. By this point, the team had a clear leader in its #1 draft pick from 1971, Austin Carr. He had become the leading scorer for the team, but a serious knee injury curtailed Cleveland's hopes for a playoff berth. The following season of 1975–76 was the pinnacle of his career with Cleveland. The team, now fabled as ""The Miracle of Richfield"", was led by team captain Carr, scoring small forward Campy Russell, shooting guard Bobby ""Bingo"" Smith, and a supporting cast of largely unknown players such as starting center Jim Chones, and an aging Nate Thurmond. The team won 49 games (a team record for 13 seasons) and the Central Division title. They defeated the Washington Bullets in seven games to advance to the Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the Boston Celtics, with Chones being sidelined by a broken foot in practice two days before the conference finals.[6] The Cavaliers did not win another playoff series until 1992. Fitch was awarded the NBA Coach of the Year Award at the end of the season. Fitch led the team to two more playoff berths, although they did not win either series. After a 30–52 record for the 1978–79 season, he resigned on May 21, 1979. On May 23, 1979, he was hired by the Boston Celtics, taking over for Dave Cowens, who had coached them to a 29–53 record as a player-coach the previous season. His first season also happened to be the first for Larry Bird. Fitch helped lead the Celtics to 61 wins along with an Atlantic Division title. In the playoffs that year, the Celtics were defeated in the Conference Finals to the Philadelphia 76ers in five games. Fitch won his second Coach of the Year Award after the season. In his second season, the Celtics drafted Kevin McHale and acquired Robert Parish, both through a trade with the Golden State Warriors. Fitch's team won 62 games along with a second Atlantic title. They went on to beat the Houston Rockets in six games to win the 1981 NBA Finals, Boston's first title since 1976. Fitch led the Celtics to a third consecutive Atlantic Division title in 1981–82 while winning 63 games, although the team lost in the Conference Finals to the 76ers in seven games. The 1982–83 team dropped in wins (from 63 to 56) while finishing second in the Atlantic Division, and were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks in four games. On May 27, 1983, he resigned from the Celtics.[7] Fitch cited Harry T. Mangurian Jr.'s announcement that he was selling the team due to difficulties with Delaware North (the owners of the Boston Garden) as the last straw, despite Fitch having three years left on his contract. On June 1, 1983, Fitch was hired by the Houston Rockets, taking over for Del Harris, who had managed the team to 14 wins the previous season. The 1983–84 Houston Rockets season also happened to be the first season with Ralph Sampson on the team. The team won 29 games that season. The next season was the season in which the Rockets drafted Hakeem Olajuwon, and the team responded with 48 wins and a playoff berth, although they were beaten in five games by the Utah Jazz. His third season was his best season with the team as they won the Midwest Division title along with the Western Conference title after beating the Los Angeles Lakers in five games. They met Fitch's old team, the Celtics. Boston beat the team in six games to win the Finals. Fitch's following two seasons led to playoff berths, although they did not advance past the Conference Semifinals. Fitch was fired on June 6, 1988. On August 21, 1989, Fitch was hired by the New Jersey Nets, replacing Willis Reed, who had gone 26–56 the previous season. The team acquired Sam Bowie on draft day in order to try and start a rebuilding process, although the team went 17–65 for the season, the fewest wins for the Nets since joining the NBA. Fitch gradually raised the team up, with acquiring of players such as Derrick Coleman, Dražen Petrović, and Terry Mills helping the team qualify for a playoff berth in the 1991–92 New Jersey Nets season. The team went to the playoffs with a losing record of 40–42, sixth-best in the 14 team Eastern Conference. They lost in the First Round to Fitch's old team, the Cavaliers in four games. On May 12, 1992, he resigned as coach of the team. On July 28, 1994, Fitch was hired by the Los Angeles Clippers, replacing Bob Weiss, who had gone 27–55 the previous year. In four seasons with the team, he could not reverse the tide of a franchise that had gone on a downward spiral since making the playoffs in consecutive seasons in 1992 and 1993. However, he led them to a playoff berth once, doing so in the 1996–97 season (the last playoff berth for the team until 2006), although they were swept in the First Round by the Jazz. They made the playoffs despite going 36–46, qualifying by just two games. The following season was a disaster, with the team finishing 17–65, the worst season since finishing with that same record in the 1994–95 season. Two days after the season ended, Fitch was fired on April 20, 1998.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/104.png

106,Cotton Fitzsimmons,"October 7, 1931","July 24, 2004","Bowling Green in Bowling Green, Missouri",Midwestern State University,1971,1997,21,true,,"""[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]""",/coaches/fitzsco99c.html,"Lowell ""Cotton"" Fitzsimmons (October 7, 1931 – July 24, 2004) was an American college and NBA basketball coach. A native of Bowling Green, Missouri, he attended and played basketball at Hannibal-LaGrange Junior College in Hannibal, Missouri and Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas. He coached the Phoenix Suns three times, was named the NBA Coach of the Year twice, and is often credited as the architect of the Suns' success of the late 1980s and early to middle 1990s. Fitzsimmons won 1,089 games in his coaching career: 223 games at the junior college level, 34 at the Division I college level and 832 in the NBA. Born to Clancy and Zelda Fitzsimmons, ""Lowell"" was raised in Bowling Green, Missouri, where he attended Bowling Green High School.[1][2] The family of six moved to Bowling Green when ""Lowell"" was young. There, his fourth grade classmates nicknamed him ""Cotton"" because of his hair. His father died when he was in fifth grade. His mother raised Cotton and three siblings.[3][4] In high school, Bowling Green High School basketball coach James A. Wilson became a key figure for Fitzsimmons. Fitzsimmons said: “Coach Wilson had the biggest influence on me of any male adult. He taught me the difference between rules and principles. Rules are made to be bent, sometimes even broken. Principles are something you live by. My mother raised me, of course, but I think I looked up to Coach Wilson as a father figure and wanted to be like him.”[3] With the 5'7"" Fitzsimmons, Bowling Green High School twice advanced to the Missouri State High School Basketball Tournament.[3] After graduating from Bowling Green High School, Fitzsimmons worked at a brick plant in nearby Farber, Missouri. He worked for two years to help support the family until his sisters graduated from high school, just as his older brother Orland had done. During those two years, Cotton played 80 game seasons for the brickyard basketball team, was a basketball referee for local high school games and was a baseball infielder on a Bowling Green town baseball team, serving as the team manager. On his first taste of coaching, he recalled, ""It's not easy going to the mound as a kid and taking out your pitcher, who's probably 30.""[4] In 1952, Fitzsimmons enrolled at Hannibal-LaGrange College (HLG), then a junior college in Hannibal, Missouri. Fitzsimmons became a junior-college All-American, averaging 25.5 points a game at Hannibal-LaGrange (where his jersey is now retired). He led the team to the NJCAA Tournament.[5][4] Fitzsimmons left Missouri to attend Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas. There, he averaged 13.3 points over 82 games and scored a career 1,095 points, while helping the Mustangs to the NAIA Tournament quarterfinals in 1956. Fitzsimmons turned down an offer to play AAU basketball for the Akron Goodyear Wingfoots and remained at Midwestern State after graduation to earn a master's degree in administrative education. He decided his ambition was to become a professional basketball coach.[3][5][4] After earning his degrees at Midwestern State, Fitzsimmons returned to Missouri. He accepted the position as head coach at Moberly Junior College in Moberly, Missouri in 1958, replacing Maury John. Fitzsimmons coached for nine seasons (1958-1967) at Moberly, with a record of 223-59 (.790). When asked in his interview how long he planned to stay at Moberly if hired, ""“I gave him the dumbest answer I ever gave anyone,” he said, “I told him I’d be there till we won two titles in a row.”[6] Fitzsimmons proceeded to finish his tenure at Moberly with back-to-back NJCAA National Championships, in 1966 and 1967.[7] Fitzsimmons was hired by Kansas State University, serving as an assistant coach in 1967-1968 under Head Coach Tex Winter. There he learned the Triangle Offense from Winter, who left after the season for Washington and recommended Fitzsimmons to replace him.[6][7] In 1968, he was named Head Coach at Kansas State. Fitzsimmons' first team at KSU finished 14-12. In 1969-1970, The Wildcats went a surprising 20-8, capturing the Big 8 Conference Championship. He was named 1970 Big 8 Coach of the Year and led the Wildcats to the Sweet Sixteen of the 1970 NCAA Tournament. Fitzsimmons then moved to the NBA with the Phoenix Suns.[8] In 1970, Fitzsimmons replaced Jerry Colangelo as Head Coach of the Phoenix Suns. It was Colangelo, serving as General Manager, who sought Fitzsimmons for the position. At first Colangelo had called Fitzsimmons and asked about other possible candidates. Eventually, Colangelo asked Fitzsimmons, “How would you like the job?”[6][9] Fitzsimmons took the position and led the Suns to their first winning season, going 48–34 that season. The relationship between Colangelo and Fitzsimmons would be lengthy, as Fitzsimmons would serve the Suns in multiple capacities, including three tenures as Head Coach. Fitzsimmons worked for Colangelo on one year contracts, without any discussion of compensation throughout their long tenure together.[6] In 1972, Fitzsimmons left Phoenix and became coach of the Atlanta Hawks. He was 140-180 in four seasons, with one playoff appearance.[10] He returned to Phoenix to reside in 1975, although he still coached the Hawks. According to Fitzsimmons, one of the main reasons he accepted a job as Hawks coach was the opportunity to coach Pete Maravich. The Hawks traded Maravich to the New Orleans Jazz in May, 1974 and Fitzsimmons was left with a young team and a rotating front office.“Presidents and GMs were flying out of here like paper clips.” he told Sports Illustrated.[11][12] On May 30, 1976, Fitzsimmons was replaced by his assistant Bumper Tormohlen with the Hawks at 28-46.[13] On August 4, 1976, Fitzsimmons was hired as player personnel director for the Golden State Warriors, to replace the late Bob Feerick, working alongside Al Attles, who was Coach and General Manager. Attles said, 'I have a long-standing relation with Cotton and have always admired and respected him as a person, coach, and evaluator of talent,""[14] There, the team made a series of trades of veteran players to acquire future draft picks.[15] Fitzsimmons quickly returned to coaching, becoming head coach by the Buffalo Braves, hired by General Manager Norm Sonju on August 5, 1977. His one season as Braves head coach (27-55) was the team's last in Buffalo. The franchise moved to become the San Diego Clippers.[16] The Braves changed owners and the team was moved and rebranded and Fitzsimmons reflected of his tenure jokingly, “I think Buffalo got a raw deal as far as the NBA,” he said years later. “I enjoyed everything Buffalo. What I feel bad about is the franchise … I guess I’ve got to take credit for folding the franchise.”[17] Fitzsimmons was immediately hired as head coach of the Kansas City Kings for the 1978-1979 season. Fitzsimmons spent six seasons with the Kings, with a 248-244 record and four playoff appearances. He won the 1979 NBA Coach of the Year Award,as the Kings finished 48-34 after finishing 31-51 the previous season.[10] In the 1981 playoffs the 6th seed, with a losing regular season record, the Kings knocked off the top-seeded Phoenix Suns and advanced to the Western Conference finals, where they lost the semi-finals to the Houston Rockets in five games.[18] Prior to the 1983-1984 season, the Kansas City Kings were sold to a group in Sacramento, California and the franchise was in limbo with a pending move to Sacramento. The Kings qualified for the playoffs and Fitzsimmons resigned after the season.[19][20][21] On May 9, 1984, Fitzsimmons left Kansas City to become head coach of the San Antonio Spurs.[22] The Spurs were 76-88 in Fitzsimmons two seasons, qualifying for the playoffs both seasons.[10] Fitzsimmons was fired by the Spurs on April 29, 1986.[23] Colangelo and Fitzsimmons reunited in 1986, as Fitzsimmons returned to the Suns organization, joining Colangelo in the Suns' front office.[24] He would later return to the bench as head coach of the Suns in 1988. He was one of the driving forces behind the trade that sent Larry Nance to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kevin Johnson, Mark West and a future first-round draft pick (who was Dan Majerle). The Suns also drafted Steve Kerr in the second round in 1988.[25] Fitzsimmons was criticized both by Suns fans and basketball critics after the trade; Nance was very popular in Phoenix. But the Suns had come off a chaotic 1987–1988 season in which they won 28 games and lost 54, and the team had been shaken by a drug scandal.[1] With the first round draft pick of 1988, the Suns chose Dan Majerle, and the franchise had a turn-around season, winning 55 games and losing 27 before advancing all the way to the Western Conference's Finals that season, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Lakers. During the 1988 Draft when Majerle was booed by the fans, Fitzsimmons publicly chastised them by saying, ""you'll be sorry that you booed this young man."" In 1989, he won his second NBA Coach of the Year Award. Fitzsimmons inherited a team that had finished 28-54, and improved them to 55-27. The Suns defeated the Denver Nuggets (3-0) and Golden State Warriors (4-1) in the playoffs before being swept by the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals.[26] After another successful season, the Suns returned to the NBA playoffs in 1990. This time around, they returned the favor on the Lakers, beating them 4 games to 1 at the Western Conference's Semi-Finals, but once again, Fitzsimmons' team fell short at the NBA's Western Conference Finals, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers, 4 games to 2. In 1991, the Suns lost to the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Playoffs' first round, 3 games to 1. During the rest of the playoffs, Fitzsimmons served briefly as a color commentator for NBC, most notably, alongside Marv Albert for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Chicago Bulls and the Detroit Pistons. In 1992, Cotton Fitzsimmons became only the sixth coach in NBA history to reach 800 wins. After losing to the Trail Blazers in that year's Western Conference Semifinals, 4 games to 1, Fitzsimmons retired as coach, to work as Suns senior executive vice-president. By then a long-time friend of Colangelo, he helped Colangelo decide to trade Jeff Hornacek, Andrew Lang and Tim Perry for Charles Barkley, while also helping with the decision of signing free agent Danny Ainge. He also did television commentary, joining Al McCoy for Suns broadcasts. In 1996, Fitzsimmons became the Suns head coach for the third time, guiding the Suns to the NBA Playoffs, where they lost to the Spurs, 3 games to 1. The 1996–97 Suns lost their first eight games, and Fitzsimmons resigned as head coach. With 832 wins and 775 losses, Fitzsimmons was the eighth winningest coach in NBA history. He has since slipped to number ten in the all-time winning list as an NBA coach. Fitzsimmons was diagnosed with lung cancer later on in life. His family chose to keep his health status private. Months after being diagnosed with cancer, his condition worsened because of a brain stroke. He suffered two more brain strokes before it was finally revealed to the public that he was in serious condition at a local hospital.[27] On July 25, 2004, the morning after his death, The Arizona Republic's sports section's headline read: ""Brightest Sun Fitzsimmons dies.""[27] ""Cotton Fitzsimmons embodied all things that are great about life and the game of basketball,"" Suns chairman and CEO Jerry Colangelo said. ""His energy, passion and upbeat approach to everything impacted those that he touched in a positive and meaningful way.""[28] Fitzsimmons was survived by his wife JoAnn, and his son, Gary.[29] Gary Fitzsimmons has had a lengthy career as a basketball assistant coach, scout and executive. He serves as Vice President and Assistant General Manager of the Atlanta Hawks.[30] Mabel McCormick a program supporter (her husband was the volunteer team doctor), who kept the scorebook and statistics for Fitzsimmons at Moberly Community College, lived to be over 100 years old. She said her relationship with Fitzsimmons was special. Mabel said that she played a role in recruiting Fitzsimmons to Moberly after having seen him play at Hannibal-LaGrange, saying she went to the board and recommended him, along with an influential sports writer from the area. ""I was convinced he was the right person,"" she said. She said of their relationship afterwards, “During his days here, Cotton was like a member of my family. He probably is my favorite. Even after he left Moberly and ended up with professional basketball we kept in close contact with one another and he would come to Moberly to visit me.”[31] “You're not going to make me have a bad day. If there's oxygen on earth and I'm breathing, it's going to be a good day.” ―Cotton Fitzsimmons[32]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/106.png

Born in Los Angeles, Fizdale attended Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he played as a point guard for the school's basketball team.[1] He subsequently attended college at the University of San Diego, where he graduated with a B.A. in communications and a minor in sociology. Between 2003 and 2016, Fizdale was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, Atlanta Hawks and Miami Heat. During his tenure with the Heat, Fizdale coached ""Team Shaq"", a squad selected by Shaquille O'Neal, at the 2013 Rising Stars Challenge during the NBA All-Star Weekend.[2] His team was defeated 163–135, by Charles Barkley's ""Team Chuck"", coached by then San Antonio Spurs' assistant coach Mike Budenholzer. After the reshuffle of the Heat's coaching staff, Fizdale became an associate head coach after Ron Rothstein decided to retire from his coaching career and Bob McAdoo was assigned to the scouting staff.

108,Tim Floyd,,,,,1999,2004,5,true,,"""[5, 1]""",/coaches/floydti99c.html,"Timothy Fitzpatrick Floyd (born February 25, 1954) is a former American college basketball coach, most recently the head coach at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). He was formerly the head coach of several teams in the NCAA and the NBA. Floyd is also known as the coach of the Chicago Bulls for four seasons. He announced his retirement from coaching after the UTEP game on November 27, 2017.[1] Born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Floyd is a 1977 graduate of Louisiana Tech University where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in health and physical education. He originally was a walk-on player at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, but he transferred to Louisiana Tech in Ruston and was a scholarship player there. His father, who was also a coach, died when Floyd was 18. Floyd and wife Beverly have one daughter, Shannon. In November 2009, a video surfaced on YouTube depicting Floyd breaking up a fight in the food court of a casino in Palm Desert, California. Floyd confirmed the video's accuracy, telling ESPN.com that ""I was leaving and then this thing happened in the food court"", referring to the fight.[2] Floyd's first coaching job was as an assistant at UTEP under Hall of Famer Don Haskins from 1977 to 1986. While Floyd was at UTEP, the Miners went to three straight NCAA Tournaments (from 1984 to 1986). They also went to the NIT three times (1980, 1981, 1983) and won four Western Athletic Conference championships in those years. Floyd's first assignment as a head coach came at the University of Idaho in Moscow; hired in March 1986,[3][4] he succeeded Bill Trumbo, who finished last in the Big Sky conference in each of his three seasons.[5][6] Floyd coached the Vandals for two years;[7][8] in his first season, the Vandals posted their first winning record since alumnus Don Monson left for Oregon after the 20–9 1983 season. The next season, they were the regular season runner-up, their best result since 1982. (After Floyd's 1988 departure, assistant Kermit Davis was promoted to head coach and Idaho won the conference title in 1989 and 1990.) At the University of New Orleans, Floyd tallied a 127–58 (.686) mark in six seasons as head coach. During his tenure, the Privateers advanced to postseason play five times, including two NCAA Tournament appearances in 1991 and 1993 and the NIT three times. At UNO, Floyd averaged 21 wins a season; he is one of only four Division I coaches who have won four conference championships in the first five years at their school. In his final season at New Orleans in 1994, the team finished 20–10. Floyd reached the 20-win plateau for the sixth time in eight seasons, and UNO made its seventh postseason appearance in eight years. Floyd was hired at Iowa State University in May 1994 as the 15th basketball coach in ISU history. In his four years at ISU, Floyd posted an 81–49 (.623) record. He is one of two coaches in Iowa State history to post three consecutive 20-win seasons along with his former player and former ISU basketball coach Fred Hoiberg. He also led the team to three straight appearances in the NCAA Tournament and three straight first-round victories. In his first season with the Cyclones, Floyd guided the team to a then-school-record 23 victories and the second round of the NCAA Tournament. During that season, the Cyclones were ranked in the AP Top 25 poll for 11 consecutive weeks, peaking at number eleven. Four of the eleven ISU losses were to 1995 NCAA Final Four teams. The Cyclones returned to the Big Eight Conference Tournament championship for the first time since 1986. In addition, during the 1995 season, Fred Hoiberg became the first Cyclone to earn All-American honors since Jeff Grayer in 1988. Picked in preseason polls to finish last in the Big Eight, the 1995–96 Cyclones finished second in the league with a 9–5 mark and won the Big Eight Conference Tournament with a win over the Kansas Jayhawks, then ranked the number five team in the nation. The Cyclones received the highest NCAA Tournament seed in school history up to that time. As the number five seed, the Cyclones defeated the California Bears but lost to the Utah Utes, then coached by Rick Majerus (who, in 2004, accepted and immediately resigned from the USC head coaching job that later went to Floyd). Iowa State's 24 victories that season was a school record. For his coaching efforts, Floyd was named Big Eight Coach of the Year and runner-up to Gene Keady of Purdue University for AP National Coach of the Year. In the 1996–1997 season, with high expectations and a national ranking as high as number four, Floyd and the Cyclones posted a 22–9 mark and advanced to their first NCAA Sweet Sixteen appearance in 11 years. In the NCAA Tournament, the sixth-seeded Cyclones defeated the Illinois State Redbirds in the first round and the Cincinnati Bearcats before losing to the UCLA Bruins in overtime in a game they led by double digits most of the game. Floyd was also responsible for landing would-be recruits, including Nick Collison and Kirk Hinrich, who would later withdraw their verbal commitments upon Floyd's departure from Iowa State. While at Iowa State, Floyd coached future pros Dedric Willoughby, Fred Hoiberg, Kelvin Cato, Marcus Fizer and Paul Shirley. In 1998, Floyd was hired as the head coach of the NBA Chicago Bulls on July 23, replacing Phil Jackson. That offseason, the players of the Bulls championship teams retired or left, leaving the equivalent of an expansion team. During the lockout season of 1998–1999, the Bulls went 13–37 (.260), and were 17–65 (.207) the next season. The team continued to lose, posting a 15–67 (.183) record in the 2000–01 season. His fourth year as coach was marred by fights with players and management; after a 4–21 start, Floyd resigned on December 24, 2001. In his four seasons with the Bulls, Floyd posted a record of 49–190 (.205). The team did not make the NBA playoffs in any of those seasons. Known as a favorite of Jerry Krause by the Chicago media, Floyd proclaimed at a July 1998 press conference introducing him to reporters, ""Don't call me Jerry's boy.""[9][10] As head coach of the New Orleans Hornets in 2003–04, Floyd posted a 41–41 record, despite the mid-season loss of Hornets star Jamal Mashburn. The Hornets lost in the first round of the playoffs, taking the Miami Heat the full seven games. Ownership was dissatisfied and dismissed Floyd after just one season. Floyd ended his NBA career with a 93–235 (.284) record, including the playoffs, admitting in interviews that, as an NBA coach, ""I wasn't very good at it"". It was announced on November 12, 2009, that Floyd would be rejoining the Hornets as a top assistant to head coach and General Manager Jeff Bower.[11] On January 14, 2005, Floyd was hired as head coach of the USC Trojans, he succeeded interim coach Jim Saia, who filled in after the school fired Henry Bibby.[12] USC had originally hired Rick Majerus on December 15, 2004, however he unexpectedly resigned five days later.[13][14] Floyd was the Trojans' immediate next choice.[12][15] Floyd's initial season may be regarded as a success. The 2005–06 Trojans finished the regular season with a 17–12 (8–10) record and sixth place in the Pac-10, including three conference losses by a combined nine points. Floyd was the subject of heightened media attention in October 2006, when 14-year-old high school freshman Dwayne Polee Jr., son of former NBA player Dwayne Polee, verbally accepted a scholarship offer from Floyd. Polee Jr. had yet to play in a high school basketball game. For the 2006–2007 season, Floyd led the Trojans to a 25–12 (13–8) record (most wins in school history) and third place in the Pac-10. He also led this team to finals of the Pacific Life Pac-10 Tournament, where they lost to Oregon. Floyd took the Trojans to the 2007 NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16, only the second USC team to do so since 1979. However, USC lost to number one seeded UNC on March 23, 2007. In the 2008 NCAA Tournament, the #6 seeded Trojans fell 80–67 to the #11 seed Kansas State Wildcats in the first round. Floyd's Trojans won the 2009 Pac-10 Tournament by defeating Arizona State, then made it to the second round of the 2009 NCAA Tournament, losing to eventual runner-up Michigan State. This marked the first time the Trojans had made a third consecutive NCAA tournament. After USC's exit from the tournament, Floyd was offered the vacant coaching position at Arizona but turned it down.[16] The off-season immediately following the 2009 tournament proved to be tumultuous for Floyd and the USC program: Key starters DeMar DeRozan, Taj Gibson and Daniel Hackett all declared for the NBA draft on the same day.[17] Floyd was accused of providing improper benefits by handing cash to Los Angeles event promoter Rodney Guillory, one of the handlers for O. J. Mayo, to influence the then-high school star to choose USC, resulting in an NCAA investigation.[16] The NCAA's 2010 infractions report for USC concluded that Floyd and other USC staffers knew about ""two separate NCAA violations, one involving [Mayo] and one where [Guillory] was found to be a runner for an agent"" but failed to take due diligence in Mayo's recruitment, thus a lack of institutional control on their part.[18] Due to the NCAA investigation and academic issues, several key recruits decommitted or chose different universities. After Marcus Johnson, who played only 16 games for USC, averaging 3.6 points, opted to turn professional, Floyd lamented to a gathering of boosters: ""Kansas has two players who would have been NBA lottery picks, Cole Aldrich and Sherron Collins, and they are returning to school. Good for them. Our guys get an offer from Islamabad and they're gone.""[17] Claiming to have lost enthusiasm for his job, Floyd resigned as the head coach of USC on June 9, 2009.[16] Floyd first notified a paper in his home state of Mississippi; his resignation was accepted by USC, which was faced with looking for a replacement late in the off-season.[19] Following an internal investigation, USC vacated its 21 wins from the 2007–08 season and withdrew from postseason consideration (including the Pac-10 tournament) for the 2009–10 season.[20] On March 30, 2010, UTEP announced the hiring of Floyd. Floyd replaced Tony Barbee who left to take a head coach job at Auburn.[21] ""Tim Floyd, who brought respectability on the court and controversy off it to the Southern California basketball program, resigned Tuesday. Floyd stepped down a month after a published report that he gave $1,000 in cash to the man who acted as a go-between when star player O. J. Mayo decided to attend USC and play his freshman season at the school.""[22] In 2013, a feud developed between Floyd and USC coach Andy Enfield. The dispute started over a top-flight prospect reneging on his letter-of-intent to UTEP, followed by disparaging comments Enfield made about Floyd and El Paso in a magazine article. The two had ""heated words"" at a November, 2013, reception in the Bahamas.[23] * USC vacated all 21 of its wins for 2007–08 after O. J. Mayo was ruled ineligible.

He formerly served as head coach of the Detroit Pistons and the New Jersey Nets, and has been an assistant coach for the Boston Celtics and the Nets. Frank was born in New York City, and grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey. He graduated from Teaneck High School in 1989, but he never made the school's basketball team.[3] He attended Camp Greylock for Boys, a sports camp in the Berkshires. He played for a Jewish Community Center team and was also a player-coach for a Catholic Youth Organization team.[4] He earned his B.S. in education from Indiana University in 1992, where he spent four seasons as a manager for the Hoosier basketball team coached by Bob Knight. During his time at Indiana the Hoosiers won the Big Ten Conference championship twice, once in the 1988–1989 season and again in the 1990-91 season. His senior year, during the 1991-92 season, Indiana reached the 1992 NCAA Final Four, but fell to Duke in a foul-plagued game in Minneapolis. Frank has frequently cited Knight as a role model and mentor.[5] Asked what he learned most of Knight, he said, ""It's more of what he stood for. If you work hard and are trustworthy it will carry you a long way. Master your subject matter, have confidence, be reliable and sincere. He is a great mentor and teacher to have at age 18. With him you started at the bottom and were given nothing. Everything you got, you earned – sweat equity."" [5] Frank served as an assistant coach at the University of Tennessee for three seasons under Head coach Kevin O'Neill. Frank first worked with O'Neill as a staff assistant at Marquette University in 1992 and during his tenure, helped lead the Marquette Warriors to two NCAA tournament berths and a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1994.[6] Frank then spent three seasons as an assistant coach for the Vancouver Grizzlies under Brian Hill. Hill would later serve as Frank's assistant with the New Jersey Nets.[6] His responsibilities with the Grizzlies included scouting upcoming opponents as well as practice and bench coaching duties. Frank became the interim head coach of the New Jersey Nets on January 26, 2004, succeeding Byron Scott, after serving as an assistant coach with the team since the 2000-01 season. He officially became the head coach of the Nets on June 21, 2004. Frank began his NBA head coaching career by achieving a 13–0 record from January 27 to February 24, 2004, setting a new NBA record for the most consecutive wins by a rookie NBA head coach. The 13-game winning streak was also the longest winning streak of a rookie head coach in any of North America's four major professional sports leagues. During this streak, the Nets won six consecutive games on the road, giving Frank the mark for the most road-game wins by a rookie head coach. The Nets picked up the extension option in Lawrence's contract on June 6, 2006, and added a two-year extension on July 23, 2007. However, Frank's tenure as Nets head coach ended on November 29, 2009, after the Nets began the season with an 0–16 record.[7] This streak was ongoing at the time of his dismissal and continued afterwards. Frank was the only coach ever in the NBA to start and end his tenure with a team with a double digit winning streak and losing streak.[citation needed] Following his firing, Frank worked as an analyst for NBATV. On July 15, 2010, Frank was hired by the Boston Celtics, replacing Tom Thibodeau as the lead assistant coach on Doc Rivers' coaching staff. On August 3, 2011, Frank was announced as the head coach of the Detroit Pistons.[8] After a loss to Oklahoma City Thunder on November 12, 2012, the Pistons fell to 0–8. This made Frank the third coach in the history of the NBA to start at least 0–8 with two separate franchises. On April 18, 2013, Frank was fired by the Pistons after going 54–94 in two seasons.[9] On June 28, 2013, he gave in to rookie coach Jason Kidd's rather public recruiting efforts to make Frank (who had coached Kidd when he played for the Nets) his lead assistant coach on the now-Brooklyn Nets. Frank's contract made him the highest-paid assistant coach in the NBA at the time (approximately $6 million over 6 years). Preferring to delegate his authority, Kidd stated that Frank's role would be to run the team's defense, while being Kidd's head-coaching mentor. Kidd placed another assistant coach, John Welch, in charge of the team's offense.[10][11] On December 3, 2013, Frank was demoted, relegated by Nets head coach Jason Kidd to merely filing team evaluation reports. This so-called ""re-assignment"" meant that Frank would be banned from being on the bench during games and from even attending team practices. This resulted from escalating tensions and squabbling between the two over the 'right' coaching philosophies, strategies, and tactics for the team.[12] On September 26, 2014, Frank negotiated a buyout from the Nets and began talks to join the Clippers staff.[13] On June 30, 2016, the Clippers promoted him to Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations.[14] On August 04, 2017, Frank promoted as President for Basketball Operation replacing Doc Rivers.

He previously coached the Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Memphis Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association (NBA), served as NBC's lead analyst, served as YES Network's color commentator/studio analyst for the Brooklyn Nets, a commentator/studio analyst for NBA TV and for nationally televised games on TNT and was also the head coach of the Ukraine national basketball team. Fratello is among the winningest head coaches in NBA history, ranking respectively 18th and 19th in all-time regular season wins (667) and games coached (1,215). Fratello was born in Hackensack, New Jersey to his parents, Vincent and Marie. He graduated from Hackensack High School, where he was captain of the basketball, baseball, football and field hockey teams. He was named to the Bergen ""All County"" Football team as a center in his senior year. He then went on to Montclair State College in Montclair, New Jersey to play football.[1] Upon graduation he returned to Hackensack High School as an assistant for both the basketball and football teams. Fratello then went on to the University of Rhode Island as a graduate assistant assigned to head coach Tom Carmody, also coaching the University of Rhode Island freshman basketball team. He had been a college basketball assistant at James Madison University under Lou Campanelli and served as an assistant for Rollie Massimino at Villanova before going to the NBA as an assistant coach for the Atlanta Hawks during Hubie Brown's tenure. He is also of Italian descent. Fratello was head coach of the Memphis Grizzlies from December 2004 to December 2006. In his first season, he inherited a 5–11 team that he turned around to win 40 games and advance to the playoffs. Fratello built on that record the following year to win 49 games and return to the playoffs for a second consecutive season. Before departing in December 2006, his record was 6–24 taking his overall record with Memphis to 95–83. Prior to working with the Grizzlies, Fratello had coached the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Atlanta Hawks. In his six seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers his record was 248 wins and 212 losses. Fratello took the Cavaliers to the playoffs four times. Fratello coached the Hawks for seven seasons and posted a 324–250 record, making the post-season playoffs five times and winning the Central Division in 1987 with 57 wins. Fratello was named Coach of the Year for the 1985–86 NBA season. His NBA career stats are 667 wins and 548 losses for a .549 average. His teams have qualified for the playoffs in eleven of his 16 seasons as a head coach. One of the most respected basketball minds despite having never won an NBA championship as a head coach, Fratello ranks 19th on the NBA's all-time win list and 21st in games coached.[citation needed] On February 24, 2011, Fratello was officially announced as the Ukraine national basketball team head coach and on March 3, 2011, he was introduced to the Ukrainian media at a press conference in Kiev.[2] After the successes he provided for Ukraine, including their first ever FIBA World Cup appearance, it was announced that Fratello would not coach for Ukraine for EuroBasket 2015.[3] He would be replaced by Yevgin Murzin as the nation's Team Ukraine basketball team. Fratello started as the color analyst for the Los Angeles Clippers from 1990-92.[4] He returned to the Clippers for the 2019 season as a rotating analyst on TV.[5] Fratello has been a television commentator for NBC Sports and is currently a main color commentator of TNT, working once again with longtime play-by-play announcer Marv Albert, who first paired up with Fratello in the 1990–91 NBA season as the main announcing team for the NBA on NBC. Starting with the 2008–09 NBA season Fratello also began working with Marv Albert doing New Jersey Nets games on the YES Network. During his stint as a color commentator, Marv Albert dubbed him ""The Czar of the Telestrator"" for his masterful way of diagramming basketball plays on screen. For the 2007–08 season, TNT rehired Fratello as a full-time commentator, allowing him to work once again with Marv Albert at NBA on TNT. Reggie Miller, who had split time between TNT's studio and the booth the past two years, also became a full-time game analyst, joining Albert and Fratello on the sidelines. Prior to Kerr's departure in the summer of 2014 to become the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, he was part of a three-man booth with his YES counterpart Marv Albert and Steve Kerr. He left the network after the 2018-2019 season Since the 2008–09 season, Fratello had worked with Marv Albert and Ian Eagle on New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets games on the YES Network. Fratello was hired after the unexpected resignation of former color analyst Mark Jackson from the network. For the 2017-18 season, he served as a studio analyst.[6] At the end of that season, he left the network to join the team at NBA TV on a full-time basis. Former Net Richard Jefferson was named as his successor.[7] Fratello is married to his wife Susan[8] with two kids, a son named Marc[9][10] and a daughter named Kristi.[11]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/111.png

With basketball king in Indiana, the team from Franklin was dubbed the “Wonder Five”. This small town about 20 miles south of Indianapolis produced a team that captured the Indiana State Basketball Championship three years in succession, 1920–1922. They became national college champions in 1923[1], playing with Franklin College and staying undefeated against teams from major universities. While they passed on a match with the New York Celtics, they twice defeated the Omars, a professional Midwest team.[2] The boys had started playing together as children and developed synergy. In high school, they thrived under the coaching of Ernest ""Griz"" Wagner and had a 104 to 10 win/loss record in their four years. After their high school successes, most members of the team followed Wagner to Franklin College, where he became basketball coach. At the time, total enrollment of the college was around 350 students. The “Wonder Five” team took on those of large universities, including Notre Dame, Illinois, Purdue, and Wisconsin. The team was undefeated in its first college season of 1922–23 and became national champions. It was not until February 1924 that the team suffered its first defeat, by Butler University, ending a string of 50 consecutive victories over a 2-season span. After ending the 1923 season undefeated, the ""Wonder Five"" were proclaimed nationally; the Detroit Free Press wrote: ""Not only has this team been the best Franklin College ever had, but it is considered as the best collegiate team ever seen in Hoosierdom, the basketball center of the world.""[citation needed] Later Coach Wagner turned down an offer to play the New York Celtics, the top professional team in the nation, saying his team was ""ready for a rest"". [3] The leading scorer on the Wonder Five was ""Fuzzy"" Vandivier. In 1924, the Chicago Tribune named him one of the ""Five Best Players"" in the nation. Coach John Wooden, of UCLA fame, considered Fuzzy the greatest high school basketball player he had ever seen.[4] After graduation, Vandivier returned to Franklin High School as the basketball coach. In 1939 he led the team to a runner-up in the state basketball tournament. He retired from coaching in 1944 but continued as the school's athletic director, as well as teaching history. Since the years of the ""Wonder Five"", the Franklin High School team took the nickname of Grizzly Cubs, and Franklin College athletic teams took the Grizzlies, both in honor of ""Griz"" Wagner. In 1980, Franklin College unveiled a banner proclaiming the ""Wonder Five"" as national college champions of 1923. In 1986, Phillip Ellett wrote a history of the team, entitled The Franklin Wonder Five: A Complete History of the Legendary Basketball Team.[5] In 2018, the Franklin Wonder Five website was launched.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/112.png

Gallatin played nine seasons for the New York Knicks in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1948 to 1957, as well as one season with the Detroit Pistons in the 1957–58 season. Gallatin led the NBA in rebounding and was named to the All-NBA First Team in 1954. The following year, he was named to the All-NBA Second Team. For his career, Gallatin played in seven NBA All-Star Games. A member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, he is also a member of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, the SIU Edwardsville Athletics Hall of Fame, the Truman State University Athletics Hall of Fame, the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame, two Illinois Basketball Halls of Fame, the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) Hall of Fame, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Hall of Fame, and the SIU Salukis Hall of Fame.[1] Growing up in Roxana, Illinois, Gallatin had taken interest in all sports and has been quoted as saying, ""Competition has always been my cup of tea.""[2] His drive for competition was amplified during his first year in high school as he attended Wood River High School from 1940–41. Since Roxana and some other outlying communities like Bethalto had no high school of their own at the time, all the athletes in the area attended Wood River, thus increasing the level of competition among them for varsity positions. The following year, however, Roxana got its own high school. He graduated from Roxana High School in 1944, and was granted a basketball scholarship by Northeast Missouri State Teachers' College (now known as Truman State University). But after graduating from Roxana High School, he enlisted in the United States Navy and served until the end of World War II.[3] At Northeast Missouri, he averaged 12.9 points per game and lead his team to a 59–4 record and two appearances in the NAIA tournament.[1] He earned his bachelor's degree from Northeast Missouri in only two years and would later receive his master's degree in physical education from the University of Iowa in 1954.[4] The New York Knicks selected Gallatin in the 1948 BAA draft. ""It was a dream come true. I really didn't know what to expect; it was my first plane ride, from St. Louis to New York. Here I am a boy from Wood River, a country boy, and going to the Big Apple"", Gallatin explained. ""All I knew was that I loved to play basketball, and the Knicks had taken me with their number one choice. So I knew that they thought I had the kind of abilities they were looking for.""[2] In his third year in the NBA, Gallatin was selected for the first NBA All-Star Game in 1951, and from 1951 to 1957 was chosen for seven consecutive NBA All-Star games. It was in the NBA where he earned the nickname ""The Horse"". He played his entire career as an undersized center at 6'6"" and 215 lbs., but made up for it with tremendous physical strength. He played nine seasons for the New York Knicks, from 1948 to 1957. His best statistical year was in 1954, when he led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 15.3 rebounds per game. That same year, he was also named to the All-NBA First Team. His most dominating single-game performance was on the last regular season game of the 1952–53 season. That night, against the Fort Wayne Pistons, Gallatin pulled down 33 rebounds, a Knicks record which still stands today.[2] In the six seasons he played when rebounds were recorded, he was among the leaders in the league in rebounds per game.[5] For his career, he averaged 11.9 rebounds per game. Gallatin still holds the Knick team record of consecutive games played, with 610.[6] After nine strong years with the Knicks, Gallatin was traded to the Detroit Pistons with Richard Atha and Nathaniel Clifton for Mel Hutchins and Charlie Tyra on April 3, 1957.[5] He played only one season for the Pistons before retiring as one of the most dominating post players of his era.[7] In addition to basketball, Gallatin also played baseball. He played two seasons of varsity baseball at Northeast Missouri.[1] During the off-seasons between his first three seasons in the NBA, he played for the Class B Decatur, Illinois Cubs/Commodores of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League, which was an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs in 1949 and the Cincinnati Reds in 1950. He appeared in 46 games in those two seasons, winning 7, losing 9 and batting .227 in 75 at-bats. After the 1950 baseball season, however, he made basketball his only professional sport.[2][8] After his retirement from playing in 1958, Gallatin became the head coach of the Southern Illinois University Salukis. In four seasons there, he led his teams to a 69–35 record and post-season tournament appearances every year. The 1961–62 team made it to the NCAA Small College (now Division II) Tournament semifinals before barely losing to eventual champion Mount St. Mary's College 58–57, then took third place by beating Nebraska Wesleyan University 98–81.[9] He returned to the NBA in 1962 as coach of the St. Louis Hawks. In his first season, he led the Hawks to the division finals and was named NBA Coach of the Year. The 1963–64 season saw the Hawks again advance to the division finals, but halfway through 1964–65 he returned to New York to coach the Knicks while Richie Guerin replaced him as coach of the Hawks. The Knicks were developing into a championship team, but the pieces were not yet all in place and Gallatin left the Knicks and the NBA midway through the 1965–66 season.[10] He became Assistant Dean of Students at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 1966, then the first athletic director and basketball coach in 1967. He remained at SIUE until his retirement in 1992, where he also taught in the physical education department and was the SIUE Cougars's men's golf coach for 24 years, leading that team to NCAA Division II championships 19 times and finishing in the top 10 six times.[11] After his retirement from coaching, Gallatin remained active and enthusiastic, while continuing to live in Edwardsville, Illinois.[2] He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1991,[12] and was also named to nine other Halls of Fame. In 2011, the New York Knicks honored him in their second ""Legends Night Awards"" along with other former Knicks stars Dick Barnett, Earl Monroe, Mark Jackson, John Starks and Allan Houston,[13] and in May 2015, the Knicks added him to Madison Square Garden's Walk of Fame.[14] Harry Gallatin died on October 7, 2015 following surgery. He was survived by Beverly Hull Gallatin, his wife since 1949; their sons, Steve, Jim, and Bill; his sister, Eileen Palmer; eight grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.[15] On June 24, 2013, Gallatin took part as the SIUE athletics department broke ground for a new golf training facility. Following approval by the SIU Board of Trustees, it was officially named the Harry Gallatin Golf Training Facility.[16] The facility, initially proposed as an on-campus venue, was moved when Sunset Hills Country Club (SHCC) in Edwardsville.offered to partner in the endeavor. The approximately $500,000, 1,840-square-foot facility was opened to SIUE students and SHCC members on December 10, 2019.

Gentry was a former college basketball player, who has led five different National Basketball Association (NBA) teams. He served as an interim head coach for the Miami Heat at the end of the 1994–95 season, and later coached the Detroit Pistons, Los Angeles Clippers, and Phoenix Suns.[1] Gentry was born in Shelby, North Carolina, where he grew up and attended Shelby High School. His first cousin is former NC State and NBA star David Thompson. Gentry played college basketball at Appalachian State University, where he was a point guard under Press Maravich and Bobby Cremins. In 1978 he spent one year as a graduate assistant at the University of Colorado. After one year working in private business, he returned to the bench when he received his first full-time collegiate assistant coaching job at Baylor University under Jim Haller in 1980. After one year at Baylor, Gentry returned to the University of Colorado as an assistant coach from 1981-1986 under Tom Apke. From 1986-1989, Gentry served as an assistant at the University of Kansas under Larry Brown, where they won the 1988 NCAA National Championship.[2] Gentry has been married twice and is the father of two sons and one daughter.[2] In 1989 he began his NBA coaching career as an assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs under Larry Brown. It was in San Antonio that Gentry met his future/current wife, Suzanne Harris. They have two children, Ryan and Jack.[2] Gentry joined Gregg Popovich, R. C. Buford, and Ed Manning as part of Larry Brown's assistant coaching staff for the Spurs when Brown left Kansas before the 1988–89 NBA season. After two seasons in San Antonio, Gentry left to become an assistant for the Los Angeles Clippers beginning in the 1990–91 season. For the 1991 season Gentry joined Kevin Loughery's staff as an assistant coach for the Miami Heat, where he coached for three seasons. He then moved to Detroit following the 1994–95 season where he served as an assistant for two and a half seasons before being named head coach late in the 1997–98 season. Gentry returned to San Antonio as head assistant coach following the 1999–2000 season, where he was reunited with former co-assistants Gregg Popovich (the Spurs head coach and vice president of basketball operations) and R .C. Buford (the Spurs' general manager). But that assignment was brief, as Gentry accepted the head coaching position for the Los Angeles Clippers weeks after taking the San Antonio job. He did a solid job with the Clippers his first two years, leading them to 31 wins and 39 wins respectively in those two seasons. Those seasons were marked by the solid play of young players, such as Darius Miles, Elton Brand and Lamar Odom. In Gentry's third season, however, the team regressed (despite the addition of Andre Miller), and Gentry was fired in February 2003. Gentry later became an assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns for six years, serving under head coaches Mike D'Antoni and Terry Porter. When Porter was fired in his first season as head coach, Alvin Gentry took over on an interim basis. He was named Suns' head coach for the 2009-2010 season. Gentry's record in his first year as head coach during the 2009-2010 season was 54 wins, a career high, against 28 losses. The Suns advanced to the Western Conference Finals and lost to the Lakers in six games. He became the fifth head coach in franchise history to lead his team to a Western Conference Finals berth in his first full season.[citation needed] Gentry figured out how to blend the two styles of D'Antoni and Porter. Comparing his coaching to D’Antoni, Gentry said ""We are not seven seconds or less. We’re 12 seconds or under. We don’t take a lot of really quick shots. We don’t play with that breakneck pace. We play with a rhythm."" Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich remarked ""One thing about Phoenix is they are better defensively than in the past. They’re much more active, much more committed, they’ve taken responsibility to a much more significant degree than ever before.""[3][4] On January 18, 2013, Gentry mutually parted ways with the Phoenix Suns.[5] In July 2013, he returned to the Clippers organization, taking the title of associate head coach, making him Doc Rivers' lead assistant.[6] After one season with the Clippers, Gentry signed a three-year contract as associate head coach for the Golden State Warriors, working under new head coach Steve Kerr.[7] On May 18, 2015, the New Orleans Pelicans were granted permission by the Warriors to interview Gentry for their head coaching vacancy.[8] He signed with the Pelicans on May 30, prior to the start of the 2015 NBA Finals, but was to remain with Golden State until the series was completed.[9] The Warriors won the NBA Championship after they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games to give Gentry his first NBA championship.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/114.png
115,Edward Gottlieb,"September 15, 1898","December 7, 1979",,Temple,1947,1955,9,true,,"""[1]""",/coaches/gottled99c.html,"Edward Gottlieb (born Isadore Gottlieb, September 15, 1898 – December 7, 1979[2]), known as ""Mr. Basketball"" and ""The Mogul"",[2][3] was the first coach and manager of the Philadelphia Warriors in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the former owner and coach of the team from 1951 to 1962. A native of Kiev, Ukraine, he was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor on April 20, 1972. The NBA Rookie of the Year ""Eddie Gottlieb Trophy"" is named after Gottlieb.[2] A small, overweight, balding man with deep eyes and penchant for wearing bow ties, Gottlieb was described by Red Smith as ""a wonderful little guy about the size and shape of a half-keg of beer.""[4] Gottlieb organized, and played for, the South Philadelphia Hebrew Association teams in the 1920s.[3] Along with a few other sports promoters, he organized the Basketball Association of America, the league that later became the NBA. Gottlieb coached the original Philadelphia Warriors, bought the team, and sent it to San Francisco in order to expand the game westward. He headed the NBA rules committee for 25 years.[2] When he died at age 81, he had been solely in charge of NBA scheduling for three decades.[2] In 1971, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. ""Gottlieb was about as important to the game of basketball as the basketball"", fellow Hall of Famer Harry Litwack said.[3] Gottlieb took on many duties. He started teams and organized leagues. He was in charge of semipro baseball in Philadelphia, and made the schedule for the Negro National League. He also helped coordinate the overseas tours of the Harlem Globetrotters.[5] The NBA might have been able to get started without him, but it probably wouldn't have survived. Sportswriter Mike Lupica wrote in a eulogy, ""They used to joke that if he got hit by a car and died, the NBA died with him.""[citation needed] Gottlieb was involved with sports throughout his life. Born Isadore Gottlieb in 1898 in Kiev,[6] he moved with his family to Philadelphia at the turn of the century. By the time he was a young adult he had not only played on but had also coached, owned, and operated neighborhood sports teams. He was, by his own admission, a born promoter and organizer, and changed his name to Edward.[6] In 1917, when he was 19, Gottlieb organized a team of mostly Jewish players representing the Young Men's Hebrew Association, which supplied the team with uniforms for three years. The players later found a new sponsor with the South Philadelphia Hebrew Association, a social club from which the team derived its new identity, the Philadelphia Sphas. The team wore uniforms with the acronym SPHAs sewn across the chest in Hebrew letters. Even after the association stopped providing the uniforms, the team kept the unusual name. Having no home court, the team nicknamed themselves ""the Wandering Jews"".[7] In the early days of the SPHAs, a game was as much a social event. ""We played in a lot of dance halls in those early years"", Gottlieb told The Associated Press. ""It was basketball, then dancing. A very nice Saturday evening for yourself and your date. We used to let the girls in for free, because you couldn't have a dance after the game without the girls. We had no trouble getting the guys to pay for the basketball game when they heard that news.""[citation needed] The SPHAs became one of the powerhouses of basketball in the East. The team entered the Philadelphia League and won two consecutive championships, the final two in the league's history. The SPHAs then joined the Eastern League, which went out of business in the same season, forcing the team to book its own games. Gottlieb, an entrepreneur and future schedule maker, had no trouble lining up a series of exhibition games against teams from both New York's Metropolitan League and the American Basketball League, which in 1925–26 began operation as the country's first major professional basketball league. The SPHAs won five of six games against ABL teams in 1925–26, losing only to the league's top club, the Cleveland Rosenblums. The SPHAs then defeated two of the game's best touring squads, the New York Original Celtics and the New York Renaissance Five (Rens), in best-of-three series.[7] In about six weeks, Gottlieb's team had won nine of 11 contests against the most celebrated squads in basketball. For the next two years Gottlieb devoted his energy to the Philadelphia Warriors, a 1926–27 ABL entry. The Warriors, who featured former SPHAs stars Chick Passon and Stretch Meehan, competed in the ABL for two seasons, posting winning records both years. The ABL, its decline hastened by the Great Depression, shut down two seasons later, in 1931. Meanwhile, Gottlieb had rebuilt the SPHAs in 1929 with younger talent, and in 1933 the team joined the ABL, which had reorganized as a smaller, regional circuit after a two-year hiatus. The clubs in this reincarnation of the ABL played in small arenas, armories, and dance halls, much as teams had in the early 1920s. The SPHAs were the premier team, winning championships in three of the league's first four seasons and taking titles in 7 of 15 years.[3] The club stayed together for 31 years, until 1949, when Gottlieb became too involved with the new Basketball Association of America. Gottlieb sold the SPHAs to Red Klotz in 1950.[2] In the spring of 1946, the United States was celebrating the end of World War II, which had formally ended in September 1945. Peace brought the population leisure time and money for entertainment, and basketball was ripe for a move to the big time. College basketball had grown immensely in popularity during the previous 10 years, and there was no professional basketball circuit (as hockey had with the National Hockey League). The National Basketball League was operating primarily in the Midwest, and did not attract the attention of other cities where basketball was popular, such as New York, Philadelphia, and Boston—which, for nearly half a century, had been the hotbeds of barnstorming teams and fly-by-night leagues. The owners or operators of major arenas in some of the country's biggest cities were looking for events to help fill their schedules. They met in New York City in 1946 and created the 11-team Basketball Association of America. The league was fashioned after the National Hockey League, with a 60-game schedule followed by championship playoffs. Of the original 11 teams, only three still survive in the present-day NBA: the Boston Celtics, the New York Knickerbockers, and the Philadelphia (now Golden State) Warriors. Gottlieb was the coach and general manager of the Philadelphia Warriors. Besides coaching, he made sure the team stayed afloat during the rocky days of the BAA and the NBA. ""He promoted the team on street corners and he sold tickets and then he counted the cold house"", Mike Lupica wrote after Gottlieb's death.[citation needed] Gottlieb coached the Warriors for a total of nine seasons, compiling a 263-318 regular-season career record and going 15-17 in the playoffs. The Warriors finished at .500 or better in four of their first six campaigns, but in Gottlieb's last three seasons they compiled losing records and failed to make the playoffs. During his coaching years, from 1946/47 to 1954/55, his teams included such early NBA standouts as Paul Arizin and Neil Johnston. Gottlieb won his lone championship with the Warriors in the first term of the BAA, 1946–47. Behind ""Jumping Joe"" Fulks, who led the league with 23.2 points per game, the Warriors logged a 35-25 regular-season record, second to the Washington Capitols in the Eastern Division. In the playoffs the Warriors defeated New York, the St. Louis Bombers, and the Chicago Stags for the title. Gottlieb and rivaling Stags coach Harold Olsen would be the first rookie coaches to compete in the championship match-ups, with such a feat not happening again until the 2015 NBA Finals with Steve Kerr of the Warriors (now in Golden State) and David Blatt of the Cleveland Cavaliers both competing for their first championships in their rookie coaching seasons in the NBA. In the league's second season the BAA lost four teams and picked up another one. The Warriors edged the Knicks by a single game in the regular season and then lost in six in the BAA Finals to the league's newest entrant, the Baltimore Bullets. For the 1949/50 season, the BAA merged with the NBL to form the NBA, a marriage in which Gottlieb was influential. ""When anyone inside the league or outside had a question, they went to Gotty"", said Leonard Koppett, who covered the NBA for the New York Post and The New York Times.[3] For the next three seasons the Warriors lost in the first round of the playoffs without winning a game. Gottlieb, who was instrumental in helping original Warriors owner Peter A. Tyrrell launch the franchise, bought the club in 1952 for $25,000. He also had a major role in shaping the league's rules, serving as chairman of the rules committee for 25 years.[2] He was there when Syracuse Nationals owner Danny Biasone came up with the idea of a 24-second shot clock in 1954, and he helped to implement a rule that gave a bonus free throw after six team fouls in a quarter. The new rules supplied the framework for a more fast-paced and exciting game and were pivotal in the continued existence and eventual success of the NBA. ""I probably was responsible for more rule changes in pro basketball than any other man"", Gottlieb told the Associated Press late in his life. ""They call me in now because I’m the only one left who can connect things to the past, who knows why this rule was put in or why that one was thrown out.""[citation needed] Gottlieb was behind the NBA's ""territorial draft"" rule, which gave teams the right to claim a local college or high school player in exchange for giving up their first-round draft pick. The rule was particularly advantageous for Philadelphia, which landed Overbrook High School's Wilt Chamberlain in 1959 after his stints with the University of Kansas and the Harlem Globetrotters. Chamberlain furthered the franchise's success. An immediate drawing card, he led the NBA in scoring and rebounding as a rookie and helped the Warriors to a 49-26 record and a trip to the division semifinals. With the Warriors for five full seasons (he was traded during his sixth season), Chamberlain took the team to the playoffs four times. In 1961/62 Philadelphia fell to Boston in seven games in the Eastern Division Finals. Before the 1962/63 season the Warriors moved west. Gottlieb, who had purchased the franchise 10 years earlier, sold it for a $600,000 profit to a credit card company, which kept 33.3 percent of the ownership while Franklin Mieuli put together a group of almost 40 Bay Area investors to purchase the remainder of the team. The move to San Francisco followed the Minneapolis Lakers' migration to Los Angeles two seasons earlier, and helped open the west to professional basketball. Gottlieb remained involved with the team in San Francisco before ""retiring"" in 1964. However, he retained his leadership position with the NBA. His role was crucial: the job of planning the league schedule had become solely his. ""They joked that Eddie Gottlieb carried the NBA around in his briefcase"", Lupica wrote.[citation needed] In any July or August, a visit to Gottlieb's office would find him in front of stacks of paper, a yellow legal pad, and graph paper. ""Gottlieb's skin would be the color of the yellow paper, and his eyes would look like black holes"", Lupica wrote. ""But he was making a season, as always.""[citation needed] Gottlieb was the force behind the NBA schedule until shortly before his death. While other sports leagues used computers, the NBA relied on Gottlieb. For 1978/79, the season prior to his death, he reluctantly gave up his duties as schedule maker to a software program.[1] A lifelong bachelor, Gottlieb remained employed by the NBA until his death in December 1979, traveling from Philadelphia to New York a few times a week as a coordinator and consultant. ""Eddie Gottlieb was one of the real pioneers of professional round ball"", Red Smith wrote in The New York Times.[8] Wrote Lupica, ""Eddie Gottlieb loved basketball. Maybe no one ever loved basketball quite the way he did."" His story is featured in The First Basket, a documentary on the history of Jews and Basketball.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/115.png

He played with the National Basketball Association's (NBA) New York Knicks from 1956 to 1963 and was a player-coach of the St. Louis/Atlanta Hawks franchise where he spent nine years.[1] On February 15, 2013, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame announced that Guerin had been elected as one of its 2013 inductees.[2] He served in the Marine Corps Reserve from 1947 to 1954. While a reservist, Guerin attended Iona College from 1950 to 1954 where he scored 1,375 points in 67 games playing for coach Jim McDermott. After graduation, Guerin served on active duty at Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, Virginia for two years.[3] The Knicks drafted Guerin with the 8th pick in the second round of the 1954 NBA draft while still on active duty. After leaving the Marine Corps, Guerin would begin his professional basketball career in 1956.[1] As a high-scoring point guard in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Richie Guerin was one of the most talented and best-loved players ever to wear a New York Knicks jersey. His feisty on-court style and wisecracking off-court demeanor played well to Madison Square Garden crowds.[4] Guerin was a machinelike scorer, a gifted passer, a smart playmaker, and one of the best rebounding and driving guards of his era. He led the Knicks in assists for five consecutive seasons and in scoring three times during his seven full seasons in the Big Apple, and he tallied more than 20 points per game in four consecutive years. The explosive Guerin also set Knicks single-game records for scoring, with 57 points in 1959, and assists, with 21 in 1958.[4] His 57-point game stood as a Knicks record until Bernard King scored 60 on Christmas Day in 1984. A fan and media favorite, Guerin played in six consecutive NBA All-Star Games. As a team, however, New York struggled, reaching the playoffs only once during Guerin's tenure. He was traded to the St. Louis Hawks midway through the 1963–64 season and spent the next eight years as the team's player-coach and then head coach. With St. Louis (and eventually Atlanta), Guerin played alongside such greats as Bob Pettit, Lou Hudson, Lenny Wilkens, and Cliff Hagan. Guerin helped the Hawks to nine consecutive playoff appearances and was named NBA Coach of the Year for 1967–68.[4] Guerin grew up in the Bronx and stayed close to home when he enrolled at Iona College in 1950 where he played center for coach Jim McDermott.[5] New York selected him in the 1954 NBA draft, but Guerin could not join the Knicks until he had completed two years of service in the Marines.[4] New York was struggling through the mid-1950s at or near the bottom of the Eastern Division. Among the only bright spots during that period were high-scoring guard Carl Braun, point guard Dick McGuire, and center Harry Gallatin. Turnover on the team was high.[4] Guerin joined the club in 1956 and quickly established himself. In only his second season he made the NBA All-Star Team for the first of six straight years. In his third year Guerin led the Knicks in assists (5.1 apg) and ranked second in scoring (18.2 ppg). He dished out a (then) team-record 21 assists against St. Louis on December 12, 1958. The 21 assists he totaled were also Madison Square Garden high until John Stockton broke the record 41 years later.[6] That year New York made its only postseason appearance with Guerin on the team, losing to the Syracuse Nationals in a first-round sweep.[4] By Guerin's fourth year in the league he had established himself as a scoring machine. He threw in outside bombs and slashed inside for layups on his way to a team-leading 21.8 points per game in 1959–60. His 57 points against Syracuse on December 11 broke Braun's previous team record of 47.[4] In 1960–61 Guerin again averaged 21.8 points, adding 7.9 rebounds and 6.4 assists per contest. He then had his finest season in 1961–62, averaging 29.5 points and a career-high 6.9 assists in a remarkable 42.9 minutes per game. Guerin ranked sixth in the league in scoring and fourth in assists, and he became the first Knicks player ever to score 2,000 points in a season (2,303). He ended that season as one of eight NBA players to ever have 2000+ points, 500+ rebounds and 500+ assists in a season.[7] By the end of the campaign Guerin had firmly established himself among the league's backcourt elite. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the third time in his first six seasons.[4] Guerin had another fine season in 1962–63, averaging a team-leading 21.5 points. He ranked seventh in the league in scoring, eighth in assists (4.4 apg), and second in free-throw percentage (.848). But two games into the 1963–64 season the Knicks traded their 31-year-old star to the St. Louis Hawks for cash and a second-round draft choice. When he left the Knicks, Guerin ranked second on the team's all-time scoring list behind Carl Braun. In his first appearance at the Garden in a Hawks uniform, Knicks fans showed their gratitude by giving Guerin a five-minute standing ovation.[4] Guerin joined a Hawks team loaded with offensive weapons, and his production dropped accordingly to 13.1 points per game in 1963–64. Midway through the 1964–65 campaign, Guerin became the Hawks' 10th coach in nine years, replacing Harry Gallatin as player-coach. St. Louis had gone 17–16 under Gallatin, and the team went 28–19 under Guerin. The Hawks earned a playoff spot but lost to the Baltimore Bullets in a hard-fought division semifinal series. Under Guerin's direction the Hawks reached the playoffs in each of the next seven seasons.[4] Guerin played two more full seasons, averaging 14.9 points in 1965–66 and 13.8 in 1966–67. After the Seattle expansion team drafted him in 1967, he announced his retirement as a player, preferring to direct all of his energies toward coaching, guiding the Hawks to a 56–26 record and the Western Division championship and being named NBA Coach of the Year for 1967–1968.[8] The Hawks moved to Atlanta prior to the 1968–69 season, and Seattle traded him back, allowing him to return to playing as a reserve player, guiding the Hawks to a 48–34 record while appearing as a player in 27 games. In the 1968–70 season he guided them to another 48-34 record while appearing as a player in 8 games. The fourth game of the 1970 Western Division Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers on April 19, 1970 was Guerin's last game as a player, and he managed to coax one more spectacular performance out of his 37-year-old body, contributing 31 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 assists, but it wasn't enough for his team to avoid a four-game sweep.[9] Guerin stayed on as head coach for two more seasons, and Atlanta went 36–46 each year. He finally left the Hawks after the 1971–72 campaign, having compiled a 327–291 career coaching record.[4] Notably, Guerin was Pete Maravich's first pro head coach during those final two pro seasons. Guerin enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve and served from 1947 to 1954. While a reservist Guerin attended Iona College from 1950 to 1954, and upon graduation was commissioned a second lieutenant. He served on active duty with the T&T Regt, MCS, Quantico, Virginia until his discharge as a first lieutenant in June 1956. He was awarded the National Defense Service Medal and the Organized MCR Medal.[10] Guerin was inducted into the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.[3] Following his retirement from professional basketball, Guerin became a Knicks sportscaster and a Wall Street stockbroker.[4] Guerin retired in 2005 following a 31-year stint first as a broker, then as managing director, for Bear, Stearns & Co. Guerin, who has four children and nine grandchildren, now resides in Palm Beach, Florida with his wife, Pat.[11]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/117.png

Harris graduated from Milligan College in 1959 cum laude with a bachelor's degree in religious studies. In 1965, Harris earned a master's degree in history from Indiana University.[1] He began his coaching career at the Junior High School level in Johnson City, Tennessee but is best known for his tenure in his native Indiana; in four years in the Indiana ranks he built a record of 54-15 over his last three seasons, winning two Conference titles and a Sectional title. He coached at three different high schools in Indiana; the Roachdale Hawks, the Dale Golden Aces and the Spencer Cops; his greatest success came at Dale, as he led the Golden Aces to a 2-year record of 35-9 and a Pocket Athletic Conference title. He also coached the Dale baseball team to a PAC title and a record of 26-7; his success built using players such as Roger Kaiser and Bob Reinhart. He moved to Spencer for the 1964–65 season where they had a 19-6 record, winning another Conference title and an IHSAA Sectional title but lost in the Regional finals to Bloomington. The following year, he was hired by Earlham College. Harris was coach at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana for nine seasons, building a record of 175-70 (.714) as he led the Quakers to three Conference (2 Hoosier Collegiate Conf. & 1 Hoosier-Buckeye Collegiate Conf) titles and two Top-12 rankings. His best seasons were 1967–68 when they were ranked 6th in the NAIA final polls with a 25-3 record, making him a finalist for NAIA national coach of the year, and in 1970–71, when the Quakers achieved a record of 24-5. In that year they won the HBCC and reached the National Tournament, losing in the 2nd round. He remains, today, as the Earlham coaching leader in wins and winning percentage. He led the Quakers to 15 conference or tournament titles during his tenure.[2] Harris coached seven summers in the Superior League of Puerto Rico while at Earlham, winning three national titles while coaching against various ABA, NBA and NCAA coaches. He coached the Iberia Superstars of the European Professional Basketball League in early 1975.[3] After becoming acquainted with Utah Stars head coach Tom Nissalke, he was invited into the professional ranks in 1975 as an assistant coach for Nissalke at the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Association (ABA). When that franchise folded, Nissalke and Harris were hired as head and assistant coach, respectively, for the NBA's Houston Rockets at the start of the 1976–77 season. They won the Central Division that year, Nissalke earning Coach of the Year honors. When Nissalke was let go by the club after the 1979 season, Harris was asked to take over head coaching duties for the 1979–80 season. Harris led the Rockets to the NBA Finals in the 1981 season, where they were defeated by the Boston Celtics four games to two in Larry Bird's first championship. Hall of Famer Moses Malone made Harris the Rockets' winningest coach in the first three years with 128 wins and three trips to the playoffs, but when Philadelphia acquired Malone in free agency, the Rockets sacrificed the season to get Ralph Sampson in the draft.

On October 3, 2011, it was announced that Harris would take over as the head coach for the Dallas Mavericks' NBA Development League affiliate the Texas Legends. At age 74 he was the oldest head coach in the history of the NBA system. The following year, he returned to being GM and Eduardo Najera was named head coach. Currently Harris is the Vice President of the Legends.[8] Starting with the 2017-2018 season, he is serving as a pregame and postgame analyst on Mavs Live on Fox Sports Southwest. Harris coached seven seasons in Puerto Rico's National Superior League (1969–75), posting a 176-61 record and winning three national championships (1973–75). His club team, the Bayamón Vaqueros, won bronze in the FIBA Will Jones Cup in 1972 in São Paulo Brazil, the championships for World Club team. He also served as head coach of the National Team for the CentroBasket games in El Salvador in 1974, winning the first international gold in Puerto Rico's history. He also coached the team to a silver in the FIBA Copa do America X Europa in São Paulo, Brazil in 1974. In 1994, he served as consultant for Canada and assisted head coach, Ken Shields, in the World Games in Toronto. He was an assistant coach under Rudy Tomjanovich with the US national team in the 1998 FIBA World Championship, winning the bronze medal. The team was handicapped by only using college players as there was a lockout in the NBA.[9] Harris also served as the first foreigner to become coach of the Chinese national men's team, where he coached NBA All-Star center Yao Ming and led China to a surprising upset victory over Serbia and Montenegro in the 2004 Athens Olympic basketball tournament. In the fall of 2011, Harris assisted coach John Calipari with the Dominican Republic national team. They won bronze in 2011 FIBA Americas Championship in Mar del Plata, Argentina (the first major basketball medal in the Dominic Republic's history). In winning the bronze medal they qualified for the 2012 World Olympic qualifier in Caracas, Venezuela. They finished fourth, thus missing to qualify for the Olympics by one game in both years. They did win the gold medal at the CentroBasket Games held in Puerto Rico prior to the World Qualifier, beating the host time for the first time ever on their home court. In 2010, he was awarded the Jerry Colangelo Award for Leadership and character on and off the court at the NBA All-Star Game in Los Angeles. In 2014, he received the Coach John Wooden ""Keys to Excellence"" Award the NCAA Final Four in Dallas. He is a member of the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame, the NAIA Basketball Hall of Fame as well as those of Milligan College and Earlham College. He has four sons (Alex, Larry, Stan, and Dominic) and one daughter (Carey). All of his children played basketball at the collegiate level (Eastern New Mexico, Eastern New Mexico, University of North Texas, Dallas Baptist University, and Marquette University respectively). He is the father of former Bucks general manager Larry Harris. On February 15, 2019, Harris was named as one of two 2019 recipients of the John Bunn Award (with Harry Glickman), awarded by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a lifetime achievement honor for those ""whose outstanding accomplishments have impacted the high school, college, professional and/or the international game.""[10] Harris appeared in some minor roles in Space Jam, Over the Top, In the House, and Diagnosis Murder[11] Harris has been inducted into the Plainfield High School (Indiana) Hall of Fame, the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame,[12] and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame.[5]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/124.png

Upon his graduation from East High School in Rochester, New York, in 1923, Harrison began playing, coaching, and organizing semi-professional basketball, working for the Rochester Seagrams and later the Rochester Ebers. In 1945, with his brother Joseph (Jack), Harrison founded his own semi-pro team, the Rochester Pros; in 1946, the franchise changed its name to Royals and began play in the National Basketball League (NBL). Harrison oversaw the NBL iteration of his team for three years, with head coach Eddie Malanowicz leading the Royals to three straight NBL finals (of which the team won one, over the Sheboygan Red Skins in 1946) and amassing a record of 99 wins and 43 losses. In 1946, Harrison, as team owner, signed Long Island University standout Dolly King; King became the first African-American to have played in the league since 1943 and the first to see substantial playing time for his team. After the 1947–48 season, Harrison moved his team to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and, after his team spent one year in the BAA, served on the committee that brokered the merger of the BAA and NBL and produced the National Basketball Association (NBA). Harrison coached the Royals through the 1954–55 season and would retire having led his team to five NBA divisional titles and the 1951 NBA championship when the Royals defeated the New York Knicks in seven games. He remained owner of the Royals for three more years, relocating the team to Cincinnati, Ohio prior to the 1957 season and selling in 1958. Harrison coached many Naismith Basketball Hall of Famers, including Bob Davies, Red Holzman, Bobby Wanzer, Al Cervi, Arnie Risen, Pop Gates and Alex Hannum. He also coached Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Otto Graham, Chuck ""The Rifleman"" Connors and Del Rice, an MLB player and the manager of the California Angels in 1972. In view of his having been a member of the boards of directors of the NBL, BAA, and NBA, having helped broker the merger of the NBL and BAA, and having been a proponent of the introduction of the 24-second shot clock, Harrison was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor in 1980. His induction class included Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Jerry Lucas, Dallas Shirley and Everett Shelton. In 1990, he was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. The basketball court at the Blue Cross Arena in Rochester is named in his honor and plays host to the Section V high school basketball tournament each year.

He served two years as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps, and then was an assistant freshman coach back at Penn for a year. He then coached at Germantown Academy for three years, then back to Penn in 1959 as an assistant coach.[3] Harter left Penn in 1965 to become head coach at Rider University, then returned to Penn as its head coach.[2] After success at Penn, with just one regular season defeat in his final two seasons, Harter was hired in April 1971 at the University of Oregon in Eugene.[3] He succeeded Steve Belko, who stepped down after fifteen years and consecutive 17–9 seasons to become assistant athletic director. Harter was regarded as one of the top defensive coaches in the 1970s, where his ""Kamikaze Kids"" at Oregon in the Pac-8 were known for a swarming defense. Many basketball notables came from Harter's Duck program, including Stu Jackson and former Oregon head coach Ernie Kent.[4] After seven seasons in Eugene, Harter left Oregon in 1978, at a salary of $38,000 annually, for Penn State and $41,000,[5] where he stayed for five seasons.[2] Harter's first job in the NBA was as an assistant coach with the Detroit Pistons in the 1982–83 season. He left in 1986 to become an assistant for the Indiana Pacers. In 1988, he was hired into his first head coaching position, with the expansion Charlotte Hornets; he was the franchise's first ever head coach.[6] In the team's second season Harter was fired in 1990 during mid-season when the Hornets' record was 8–32.[7] Harter went on to be an assistant coach for the New York Knicks under Pat Riley (1991-1994), Portland Trail Blazers under P.

127,Lew Hayman,,"June 28, 1984",,Syracuse,1947,1947,1,true,,"""[]""",/coaches/haymale99c.html,"Lewis Edward Hayman (September 30, 1908 – June 28, 1984)[1] was an American sports figure. He was one of the driving forces behind the Canadian Football League as coach, general manager, team president, and league president. As head coach, he was a five-time Grey Cup winner with three different teams. Hayman was a pioneer in bringing African Americans into the CFL, hiring one of professional football's first Black player, Herb Trawick, and coach Willie Wood.[2] He was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.[3] Hayman was born to a Jewish family in New York City and grew up in Paterson, New Jersey. He attended high school at New York Military Academy and was a star basketball player at Syracuse University, where he was a three-year starter and named College Humor third team All-American in 1931. He also played for the Syracuse football team. After graduating from college, Hayman moved to Canada in 1932 to become assistant coach of the University of Toronto football team under Warren Stevens. He was soon also hired as an assistant to coach Buck McKenna with the Toronto Argonauts football team. When McKenna took ill during the 1932 season, Hayman became interim head coach. He was given the job outright for the 1933 season and, at the age of 25, guided the Argonauts to a Grey Cup championship. He followed that with back-to-back Grey Cup wins in 1937 and 1938. With World War II escalating, the major Canadian football leagues halted operations following the 1941 season and Hayman joined the Royal Canadian Air Force as a flying officer. He was made coach of Toronto's RCAF football team and led the Toronto RCAF Hurricanes to the 1942 Grey Cup championship. He was discharged after the war, having reached the rank of flight lieutenant. Hayman thought he had an agreement with the Argonauts to return as head coach when play resumed in 1945, but the deal fell through and Ted Morris was hired instead. That left Hayman with bitter feelings toward his former team—which admitted that they had misled him[4]—and Hayman had to settle for a job as coach of the Toronto Indians football team. One of the members of the Indians was future CFL commissioner Jake Gaudaur, who had also played under Hayman in the RCAF. The following season, Hayman partnered with Eric Cradock and Leo Dandurand to form the Montreal Alouettes CFL team, with Hayman as head coach and general manager, as well as part-owner. In his first season, he broke the league's color barrier by signing Herb Trawick, an African American lineman. Other innovations introduced by the Alouettes under Hayman were playing night games, scheduling games on Sundays, and allowing games to be televised. During the off-season in 1946, Hayman became general manager of the Toronto Huskies professional basketball team, the first Canadian-based team in what evolved into the National Basketball Association (known at the time as the Basketball Association of America). When the team's first coach quit a month into the season, Hayman took his place for one game, and is in the record books as having been an NBA coach for that single game. The Huskies disbanded after one money-losing season. Hayman led the Alouettes to their first Grey Cup in 1949 — Hayman's fifth and final Grey Cup as head coach. Following the 1951 season, Hayman stepped down as coach but continued as general manager until the end of the 1954 season. Following the latter, he sold his share of the Alouettes and moved back to Toronto to become a stockbroker. Hayman's career outside of football was short-lived, as he became managing director of the Argonauts in 1956. Despite his previous success as head coach, the Argonauts were largely reduced to being Eastern Conference doormats through this period, finishing last in their division nine times in 11 years from 1956 to 1966 before returning to respectability. During that time, Hayman also became team president. He was elected president of the CFL in 1969 and served a one-year term. After John Barrow was made general manager of the Argonauts in 1972, Hayman was given the title of executive consultant. He was planning to retire when the season ended, but was persuaded by owner John Bassett to sign a three-year contract as team president, followed by 10 years as vice-chairman and director. Hayman again became president of the Argonauts in 1979 and remained in that role until he was succeeded by Ralph Sazio during the 1981 season. He died in 1984 at age 75. Hayman was elected to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1975. The CFL award presented to the outstanding Canadian player in the East Division is called the Lew Hayman Trophy. In 2004, he was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/127.png

He played collegiately at the University of Oklahoma and was selected by the Seattle SuperSonics in the third round of the 1970 NBA draft. He had a 15-year NBA career for four teams (the Sonics, the Buffalo Braves/San Diego Clippers, the Chicago Bulls, and the Phoenix Suns). Heard is best known[by whom?] for a buzzer beater he made to send Game 5 of the 1976 Phoenix–Boston championship series into a third overtime. This feat is commonly known as ""The Cow"", or ""The Shot Heard 'Round the World"", in reference to Ralph Waldo Emerson's poem ""Concord Hymn"", which was written about the Battle of Lexington.[citation needed] Heard set an Oklahoma school record with 21 double-doubles for a season by a Sooner in 27 games during 1969–70. It was finally broken by Blake Griffin on February 14, 2009.[1][2] Prior to the 1973–74 NBA season, Heard and Kevin Kunnert were traded from the Chicago Bulls to the Buffalo Braves for John Hummer, a 1974 NBA draft 2nd round pick and a 1975 NBA draft 2nd round pick. Heard went on to rank in the top ten in rebounds and blocked shots that season.[3] The deal was part of the resume that earned Buffalo Braves General Manager Eddie Donovan the NBA Executive of the Year Award.[4] Heard once played 86 games in an NBA season, which is 82 games long, when he was traded in the middle of the 1975–76 NBA season from Buffalo to the Phoenix Suns.[3] With two seconds remaining in double overtime, John Havlicek had given Boston a one-point advantage with a running one-handed shot. The Celtics' timekeeper then ran the clock out instead of stopping it after a made basket, per league rules. The Boston Garden crowd erupted, believing the game was over, and the Celtics themselves actually went back to their locker room. Legend has it that Havlicek had actually taken the tape off his ankles by this stage. But the Suns correctly pointed that there was still time left, though the officials only placed one second back on the clock instead of two. (Celtics fans had stormed the court after the time was erroneously allowed to expire, and one particularly boisterous fan attacked referee Richie Powers after it was announced that the game was not over yet.) Paul Westphal then intentionally took a technical foul by calling a timeout when the Suns had no more timeouts to use. It gave the Celtics a free throw, which Jo Jo White converted to give Boston a two-point edge, but the timeout also allowed Phoenix to inbound from mid-court instead of from under their own basket. When play resumed, Heard caught the inbound pass and fired a very high-arcing turnaround jump shot from at least 20 feet away. It swished through, sending the game into a third overtime. However, Boston eventually won the game and the Finals, four games to two. Heard had scored 17 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in Game 5. A revision to Rule 12-A, Section I, in regards to excessive timeouts, resulted in the elimination of the advancement of the ball following an excessive timeout. The rule has since been changed to award the ball to the team shooting the free throw. In addition to his playing career, Heard served as head coach of the Dallas Mavericks from 1993–1994 and the Washington Wizards from 1999–2000. His overall head coaching record is 23-74. During the 2004–2005 season, Heard was an assistant coach with the Detroit Pistons; he coached several games that season when Larry Brown was out due to a medical condition. Heard has also served several stints as an assistant coach for the Indiana Pacers.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/128.png

He has been associated with the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA) for six decades as a player, coach and broadcaster. He played for the Celtics from 1956 to 1965, and also coached the team from 1969 to 1978. He has since spent over thirty years as the color commentator for the Celtics' local broadcasts alongside play-by-play commentator Mike Gorman. He has been regarded as one of the most iconic and charismatic Celtics of the 1950s-60s championship teams, being called “the godfather of the city of Boston,” by former teammate John Havlicek. Tom Heinsohn has been granted Hall of Fame status for his contributions as a player. He has also been inducted into the Hall of Fame for his success as a head coach. He also helped form the NBA Players Association. Heinsohn is the only person to have the distinction of being involved in an official team capacity in each of the Celtics' 17 championships, as well as each of their 21 NBA Finals appearances. Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, Heinsohn was a standout at St. Michael's High School in nearby Union City. He accepted a scholarship to Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts and became the school's all-time leading scorer with 1,789 points, an average of 22.1 points per game. During his senior year, Heinsohn scored a school record 51 points in a game against Boston College. In 1956, Heinsohn was chosen as the Boston Celtics 'regional', or 'territorial', draft pick. In his first season, Heinsohn played in an NBA All-Star Game, was named the NBA Rookie of the Year over teammate Bill Russell, and won his first championship ring. He was part of a Celtics squad that won eight NBA titles in nine years, including seven in a row between 1959 and 1965. In NBA history, only teammates Russell and Sam Jones won more championship rings during their playing careers. During his playing career, Heinsohn was named to six All-Star teams. On the day his teammate and fellow Holy Cross Crusader Bob Cousy retired, Heinsohn scored his 10,000th career point. His number 15 was retired by the Celtics in 1965. Off the court, Heinsohn played an important leadership role in the NBA Players Association. He was the association's second president (following founding president Bob Cousy), and was instrumental in the league's acceptance of free agency following a showdown at the All-Star game in 1964, in which the All-Star players, led by Heinsohn, threatened to strike. Heinsohn became the Celtics' head coach beginning in the 1969–70 season. He led the team to a league best 68–14 record during the 1972–73 season and was named Coach of the Year, although Boston was upset in the playoffs. The next season Heinsohn and the Celtics won the championship, and they claimed another title in 1976. He accumulated a career coaching record of 427–263. On February 14, 2015, it was announced that Heinsohn would be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for a second time as a coaching inductee.[1] He is one of five members of the class of 2015 who were directly elected and is just one of four people to be inducted as both a player and coach.[1] Heinsohn's broadcasting career began in 1966, calling play-by-play for WKBG's Celtics broadcasts, after being asked by Red Auerbach.[2] He spent three seasons in this role before becoming coach in 1969. From 1990 to 1999, Heinsohn was the Celtics' road play-by-play man on WFXT, WSBK and WABU. In 1981, Heinsohn joined Mike Gorman as color commentator in the Celtics' television broadcasts; they have since become one of the longest-tenured tandems in sports broadcasting history. Occasionally, Bob Cousy makes appearances with the tandem of Heinsohn and Gorman. For a time in the 1980s, Heinsohn was in the same capacity during CBS's playoff coverage of the NBA (with Dick Stockton), calling four Finals from 1984 to 1987, three of which involved the Boston Celtics against the Los Angeles Lakers. Heinsohn also teamed with Brent Musburger and James Brown during his time with CBS. On Celtics broadcasts, Heinsohn likes to point out players who display extra hustle to help the team by giving them ""Tommy Points."" One player in each game has exceptional play and hustle highlighted for the ""Tommy Award[permanent dead link]"". During broadcasts he is known for his sense of humor and indignantly questioning game officials when calls against the Celtics appear to be made in error. Away from the court, Heinsohn enjoys painting and playing golf; he once headed a life insurance company. Recently, Heinsohn has worked fewer games due to age and health issues. Brian Scalabrine, the Celtics' studio analyst, has filled in for Heinsohn during his rare absences at home games and now has taken over for Heinsohn on all road games. He started to take on this role during the 2012–13 NBA season, and during the 2014–2015 NBA season became full-time on road games. When the Celtics are having a road game, Heinsohn works as a studio analyst on the Celtics' television broadcasts.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/129.png

He turned to coaching basketball after his retirement from playing in 1942, but returned to play two games with the Providence Steamrollers of the Basketball Association of America while serving as the team's coach in 1948. Aged 45 years old at the time of his two appearances, Hickey holds the record for the oldest player in NBA history. As a 5'11"" guard/forward, Hickey played from the 1920s through 1940s with multiple early professional teams, including the Hoboken St. Joseph's, Eddie Holly's Majors, New York Crescents, Cleveland Rosenblums, the Chicago Bruins, Boston Trojans, Original Celtics of the American Basketball League and the Pittsburgh Raiders, Indianapolis Kautskys, and Tri-Cities Blackhawks of the National Basketball League. In the second year after the formation of the Basketball Association of America (the forerunner to the NBA), Hickey served 29 games as head coach of the Providence Steamrollers during the 1947–48 season. Hickey's team posted a 4–25 record during his tenure. He activated himself as a player on January 27, 1948, three days before his 46th birthday, and appeared in two games. He attempted six field goals – making none – and committed five personal fouls. He scored two points off of foul shots.[2] All of the shots occurred in his debut game as a player against the St. Louis Bombers. While he also played a day later against the New York Knickerbockers, he didn't record anything in that game. As a result of these games, Hickey still holds the record for the oldest player in NBA history at 45 years and 363 days.[3] Aside from basketball, Hickey enjoyed a lengthy career in baseball, playing 15 minor league seasons and managing two. Hickey managed and played several seasons of minor league baseball as an outfielder.

Hill grew up in Mount Sterling, Ohio, moving to Worthington, Ohio for high school. Hill attended Bowling Green State University. Hill played basketball and baseball collegiately at Bowling Green State University and was also a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity. He attended the school during a time when college players were not eligible to join the varsity squad until their sophomore seasons; although statistics indicated he showed tremendous promise as a member of the freshman team, his success never really translated over to his tenure as a member of the varsity team.[1] He then became interested in coaching. Hill was an assistant coach for the Kansas Jayhawks from 1979-85. Hill coached the New York Knicks in 1986–87, and went on to be an assistant for the Pacers under Dick Versace. On December 20, 1990, Hill was promoted to head coach of the Pacers after Versace's firing.[2] He spent three seasons as the Indiana Pacers' head coach (1990–93). He led the Pacers to the NBA playoffs. After being fired by the Pacers and being an assistant coach for the Orlando Magic for a season, Hill piloted the San Antonio Spurs to an NBA-best 62 wins in 1994–95 before losing to the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference finals. After a 3-15 start to the 1996–97 season, Hill was fired by one of his bosses, Gregg Popovich, who thereafter replaced Hill as the Spurs coach. Hill's firing at the time was puzzling to some and deeply angered Hill, considering his previous success and the fact that the poor start to the season was due in large part to injuries to David Robinson and Sean Elliott, the team's two best players.[3][4] Between 1999 and 2003, Hill was head coach at Fordham University where he compiled a 36–78 record (31.6% winning %). He was let go by the Rams following the 2002–03 season after only 1 win in the Atlantic 10. The Rams finished 2–26 in 2003, the worst record in school history. Fordham paid Hill $650,000 to leave the university in a buyout agreement four years into his 10-year deal.[5] Hill took responsibility for his rocky four-year tenure at Fordham. ""Fordham was my fault; I just shouldn't have done it,"" Hill told the New York Daily News. ""I don't want to get into why,"" he added. ""Just blame it on me.""[6] ""I guess the best way to put it (is), I've had a really privileged career,"" Hill said. ""I've been around a lot of great organizations; I've had a lot of great players. I've always had success to some degree, so I feel like I understand what it takes to do that and it just didn't work."" Asked to recount some of the missteps he made during his tenure at Fordham, Hill said that he made a mistake before the 2002–03 season in trying to bring in playground players such as Adrian Walton and Smush Parker. ""We tried to bring the Rucker League to Fordham and it didn't work out,"" Hill said. Hill added he didn't have any regrets about his time in the Bronx. ""It's a good school, good people, the whole thing, but I made a mistake,"" Hill said. ""I don't really regret it,"" he added. ""I've learned so much about what those young guys go through to try to be successful. It's hard for them."" (Ian Begley) On January 3, 2006 Hill replaced Bob Weiss as head coach of the Seattle SuperSonics, after a lackluster 13–17 start to the 2005–06 season; he had most recently served as assistant coach for the team. He was fired over the phone as Sonics head coach on April 24, 2007 after their penultimate season in Seattle, after which they became the Oklahoma City Thunder. He holds a career win-loss NBA coaching record of 310–293. On February 1, 2016, it was announced that Hill would be the Phoenix Suns' newest assistant head coach for the rest of the 2015–16 season after it was announced that the Suns would fire Jeff Hornacek as their head coach and replace him for the season with his former player under the Seattle SuperSonics, Earl Watson. After his contract for 2016 expired, it was announced that the contracts for both Hill and Corey Gaines would not be renewed with the team. During the summer of 2011, Hill was invited by Nike to help the Taiwan men's basketball team as a consultant. He also has coached the Tokyo Apache of the Japanese bj league.

Born in East Orange, New Jersey, Hill graduated from Our Lady of the Valley High School in Orange, New Jersey in 1965 and John F. Kennedy College in Nebraska in 1969 with a degree in physical education. Hill was a three-year starter on the Kennedy basketball team.[2] In 1970, Hill began his coaching career as head coach at Clifford Scott High School in his native East Orange, New Jersey. Hill then was an assistant coach at Montclair State College from 1972 to 1974.[2][3] Hill then spent one season as an assistant coach at Lehigh University and served as head coach for Lehigh from 1975 to 1983.[3] In eight seasons at Lehigh, Hill had a 75–131 record; Lehigh's best record under Hill was 14–12 in 1980–81.[4] In 1983, Hill joined head coach Bruce Parkhill's staff at Penn State.[5] Hill began his NBA coaching career in 1986 as an assistant coach for the Atlanta Hawks under Mike Fratello.[2] The two met at Montclair State College when Hill was studying to be certified as a driver's education teacher.[6] In 1990, Hill joined the Orlando Magic as an assistant coach under Matt Guokas.[2] He was the head coach of the Orlando Magic from 1993 to 1997 and is the Magic's most successful coach with a record of 191–104. During that time period, he led the Magic to their first NBA Finals in 1995 and also led the team to a 60–22 record the following season. However, following the loss of star center Shaquille O'Neal to free agency during the off-season, he was fired mid-season in 1997 after a player revolt was led by disgruntled star Penny Hardaway.[7][8] Following his firing from the Magic, he became head coach of the third-year, expansion Vancouver Grizzlies in 1997. Hill was fired early in his third season. Following that, he became an assistant coach of the New Jersey Nets, where he remained until the end of the postseason. He was then rehired by the Magic and he led the team to a 36–46 record in the 2005–2006 season.[2] On May 23, 2007, after multiple media sources reported that Hill would not return to coach the Orlando Magic for the 2007–08 NBA season, but would instead be offered another position within the organization,[9] the Magic released a statement that he would not return as coach of the Magic,[8] although it was reported he was actually fired by general manager Otis Smith.[10] It was a position he had held since May 24, 2005.

He currently is the head coach for the University of Nebraska men's basketball program. Previously he served as the head coach for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA) before his firing on December 5, 2018. Hoiberg has also served as the men's basketball head coach for Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. Hoiberg grew up in Ames, and played college basketball at Iowa State. He then played professional basketball for ten years and served as vice president for basketball operations for the Minnesota Timberwolves before beginning his coaching career. Hoiberg, a multi-talented athlete, was the quarterback of the football team and the captain of the basketball team at Ames High School in Ames, Iowa. He led his basketball team to a state championship in 1991, and was honored as the State of Iowa's ""Mr. Basketball"" that year. He chose to play basketball for his hometown Iowa State Cyclones, then of the Big Eight Conference, over many other offers. He played three seasons for coach Johnny Orr and one season for Tim Floyd. Hoiberg was a First-Team All-Big Eight selection in 1995. Arguably the most popular player in the history of Iowa State basketball, Hoiberg is among the top seven positions for nearly every statistical category, and his number 32 has been retired by Iowa State. In college, he was known as an all-around player, capable of making clutch shots in important situations. While at Iowa State, Hoiberg joined Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Hoiberg obtained the nickname ""The Mayor"" after receiving several write-in votes during the 1993 Ames, Iowa mayoral race.[1] The National Federation of State High School Associations announced in 2012 that Hoiberg was elected to the National High School Hall of Fame.[2] At 6 ft 4 in. (193 cm) and 210 lbs. (95 kg), Hoiberg played shooting guard. He was selected 52nd overall by the Indiana Pacers in the 1995 NBA draft. In 1999, after four years with the Pacers, he signed as a free agent with the Chicago Bulls, at that time coached by Floyd, where he remained for four years. On July 28, 2003, Hoiberg signed as a free agent to play for the Timberwolves, where he received greater acclaim as a three-point specialist. In 2005, Hoiberg became the first player in NBA history to lead the league in three-point shooting percentage and not be invited to the three-point shooting competition in that season's All-Star event. Hoiberg underwent surgery in June 2005 to correct an enlarged aortic root (aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva). The operation was successful, but after a brief comeback attempt as a player, on April 17, 2006, Hoiberg announced his retirement from basketball to take a job in the Timberwolves front office. On April 27, 2010, Iowa State University announced that Hoiberg would take over as head basketball coach, replacing Greg McDermott, who left ISU to take the head coaching position at Creighton.[3] In taking over the reins at ISU, Hoiberg became the school's 19th men's basketball coach. He won his first game, an unofficial exhibition, over Dubuque on November 5, 2010, 100–50. Hoiberg won his first official game against Northern Arizona, 78–64, on November 12, 2010, while his first Big 12 victory came against Baylor, 72–57, on January 15, 2011, in Hilton Coliseum. In 2011–12, Hoiberg led the Cyclones to a 23–11 record and the program's first NCAA Basketball Tournament appearance since 2005.[4] The season also included the team's first ranking in the AP Top 25 poll since 2005.[5] Hoiberg was declared 2012 Big 12 Co-Coach of the Year after winning nine more games during the 2012 conference season than in 2011, the largest season-to-season improvement in Big 12 history.[6] In April 2013, Hoiberg signed a 10-year contract extension with Iowa State worth $20 million. Hoiberg's contract had a $2 million buyout clause if he left for another college coaching position, but the buyout was only $500,000 if he left to become an NBA head coach or general manager. Hoiberg became the fastest coach in Iowa State history to notch 100 wins (in 148 games) on December 31, 2014, when Iowa State defeated Mississippi Valley State in Hilton Coliseum. On June 2, 2015, the Chicago Bulls hired Hoiberg as head coach under a 5-year contract worth $25 million.[7] In his rookie season as head coach, the Bulls missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years, failing to meet preseason expectations. In his second season, the Bulls lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Boston Celtics after taking a 2–0 lead, and were again perceived as underachieving. In March 2017, ESPN ranked Hoiberg as the worst head coach in the league.[8] On December 3, 2018, the Bulls dismissed Hoiberg after a 5-19 start to the 2018-19 season. Hoiberg was replaced by Jim Boylen as head coach.[9] On March 30, 2019, Hoiberg was named head coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball team.[10][11] Hoiberg is the son of an Iowa State sociology professor (father) and elementary school teacher (mother), and received a degree in finance from ISU in 1995. His grandfather, Jerry Bush, was also once the head basketball coach at Nebraska.[12] When growing up in Ames, he lived within walking distance of ISU's basketball arena, Hilton Coliseum.[13] He and his wife Carol, also from Ames, have four children (Paige, Jack, and twins Sam and Charlie). On April 17, 2015, Hoiberg underwent a successful replacement of his aortic valve at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/133.png

During his ten-year NBA career playing as a point guard he played for five teams, averaging 11.6 points and 4.5 assists per game. Drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers with the sixth pick of the 1975 NBA draft out of Arizona State University, Hollins was bestowed All-Rookie first team honors that season, averaging 10.8 points in 78 games for the Blazers. Prior to his two seasons at Arizona State, he played two years[1] at Dixie College in St. George, Utah.[2] He graduated from Arizona State University in 1986 with a degree in sociology. He was a member of Trail Blazers' 1976–77 championship team, and made his only All-Star Game appearance one year later. He was a member of the NBA All-Defensive team twice, in 1978 and 1979. On April 18, 2007, the Portland Trail Blazers retired his #14 jersey. Prior to his head coaching career, Hollins served as an assistant coach at Arizona State in the 1985–86 season and again in the 1987–88 season.[1] He then served as an assistant for the Phoenix Suns under head coaches Cotton Fitzsimmons and Paul Westphal from 1988 to 1995. In the 1999–2000 season, Hollins acted as the interim head coach while the Grizzlies were still located in Vancouver. He served another stint as interim coach of the Grizzlies in 2004, after the team had moved to Memphis. On May 14, 2008, Hollins was hired as one of Milwaukee Bucks head coach Scott Skiles' assistants.[3] On January 25, 2009, Hollins was named the Grizzlies' head coach for the third time in the franchise's history.[4] On February 11, 2011, Hollins won his 100th career victory, as coach of the Memphis Grizzlies, in an 89–86 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.[5] That season, he led his team to a 46–36 record, earning the eighth seed in the playoffs. The Grizzlies defeated the number-one seed San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Oklahoma City Thunder in seven games in the Western Conference semifinals. In the lockout-shortened 2011–12 NBA season, Hollins' Grizzlies finished the season with a 41–25 record and the best winning percentage in franchise history (.621). After guiding the Grizzlies to a 13–3 record during the month of April, Hollins was named April's Coach of the Month.[6] This streak helped the Grizzlies earn the four seed in the Western Conference, with home court advantage for the first time in franchise history. They lost in the first round to the Los Angeles Clippers in seven games. In 2012–2013, Hollins led Memphis to a franchise record 56-win season. Memphis lost to the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals in a four-game sweep. Differing views between Hollins and management seemed to be pointing to an eventual change despite Hollins' success. Even though it was announced that Hollins' contract would not be renewed by the team on June 10, 2013, he was still the Grizzlies' most successful coach, having improved the team's record almost every season. He led them to three straight playoff appearances, their first playoff win, a franchise best .683 winning percentage, and the first playoff series victory in franchise history. .[7] In the time between Memphis and Brooklyn, Hollins chose Kauffman Sports Management Group as his representation.[8] On July 2, 2014, Hollins and the Brooklyn Nets reached an agreement for him to serve as the team's head coach for the next four seasons.[9][10] On July 7, 2014, he was officially introduced by the Nets at a press conference.[11] In his first season as head coach, he guided the Nets to the playoffs. On January 10, 2016, he was relieved of his head coaching duties by the Nets after starting the 2015–16 season with a 10–27 record.[12] On July 31, 2019, the Los Angeles Lakers hired Hollins as an assistant coach.[13][14] Hollins's son, Austin Hollins, played college basketball for the University of Minnesota's men's basketball team.[15] His son has also played professionally in the EuroLeague, with the Russian club Zenit Saint Petersburg.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/134.png

He is probably best known as the head coach of the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1967 to 1982. Holzman helped lead the Knicks to two NBA Championships in 1970 and 1973, and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1986. In 1996, Holzman was named one of the Top 10 Coaches in NBA History.[1] Born in Brooklyn[2] (or according to some sources, in Lower East Side[3][4]), New York in 1920, to Jewish immigrant parents, as the son of a Romanian mother and Russian father.[5] Holzman grew up in Brooklyn's Ocean Hill–Brownsville neighborhood[3] and played basketball for Franklin K. Lane High School in the mid-1930s. He attended the University of Baltimore and later the City College of New York, where he played for two years until graduation in 1942. Holzman joined the United States Navy in the same year, and played on the Norfolk, Virginia Naval Base team for two years. Holzman was discharged from the Navy in 1945 and subsequently joined the NBL Rochester Royals, which won the NBL championship in Holzman's first season. Holzman was Rookie of the Year in 1944–45.[6] In 1945–46 and 1947–48 he was on the NBL's first All League team; in the interim year he was on its second team.[7] Holzman stayed with the team through their move to the NBA and subsequent NBA championship in 1951. In 1953, Holzman left the Royals and joined the Milwaukee Hawks as a player-coach, eventually retiring as a player in 1954 but continuing as the team's head coach. During the 1956–1957 season, Holzman led the Hawks (then in St. Louis, Missouri) to 19 losses during their first 33 games, and was subsequently fired. In 1957, Holzman became a scout for the New York Knicks for ten years ending in 1967, whereupon he became the team's head coach for the most part until 1982.[8] (Holzman's former player, Willis Reed, replaced him as Knicks head coach in 1977, but Holzman returned near the start of the 1978–1979 season.) During this 15-year span as Knicks' coach, Holzman won a total of 613 games, including two NBA championships in 1970 and 1973. In 1969, Holzman coached the Knicks to a then single-season NBA record 18-game win streak, breaking the 17-game record first set back in 1946. For his efforts leading up to the Knicks' 1970 championship win, Holzman was named the NBA Coach of the Year for that year. He won his second NBA championship as the Knicks won the 1973 NBA Finals against the Lakers.[9] He was one of very few individuals to have won an NBA championship as both player and coach. As a coach, his final record was 696 wins and 604 losses. In 1985, he was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The New York Knicks have retired the number 613 in his honor, equaling the number of wins he accumulated as their head coach. He is also a member of the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.[10] He lived with his wife in a home they bought in Cedarhurst, New York in the 1950s.

He was the head coach for both the Phoenix Suns (2013–2016) and the New York Knicks (2016–2018) of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played shooting guard in the NBA from 1986 through 2000. He attended Komarek Elementary School in North Riverside, Illinois, and Gurrie Middle School and Lyons Township High School in La Grange, Cook County, Illinois. Hornacek redshirted at Iowa State University (ISU) in 1981; he was a team walk-on who played from 1982 to 1986.[1] The son of a high school basketball coach, he became an all-conference player in the Big Eight Conference, playing for coach Johnny Orr. As a point guard he guided the Cyclones to the Sweet Sixteen of the 1986 NCAA tournament. His shining moment came at the Metrodome in Minneapolis when, after first hitting a shot to tie the game and send it to overtime, Hornacek hit the game winning shot in overtime, a 26 foot jumper at the buzzer, to give ISU its first NCAA tournament victory since 1944, beating Miami University, March 14, 1986, 81–79. Two days later, he led the Cyclones to the NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen, in a 72–69 upset of second seed Michigan. Orr, who had previously left Michigan to coach at Iowa State, called it the greatest victory of his career. Hornacek left ISU with a Big-8 record of 665 career assists and 1,313 career points. He was the fourth player in Cyclone basketball history to have his number retired when his No. 14 jersey was hung from the rafters of Hilton Coliseum in 1991. He was the 22nd pick in the second round (46th overall) of the 1986 NBA draft, by the Phoenix Suns. The 2nd round draft pick that was used to select him was traded three times before finally ending up with the Suns. First, the Los Angeles Lakers packaged it in the deal to acquire Byron Scott from the San Diego Clippers before the 1983–84 season. A week later, the Clippers sent the pick to the Detroit Pistons in a deal to acquire Ricky Pierce, and on that same day, the Pistons dealt the pick to the Suns for David Thirdkill. The Suns struggled in Hornacek's first two seasons, but after hiring Cotton Fitzsimmons as coach and acquiring free agent Tom Chambers, the Suns went from 28 wins in 1987–88 to 55 in 1988–89. Hornacek was a ""third option"" on offense after Chambers and Kevin Johnson. This trio led the Suns to four straight NBA playoff appearances, including two Western Conference Finals. After his sixth and most productive season in 1991–92, in which he led the Suns in scoring average (20.1 ppg) and earned an All-Star appearance, Hornacek was traded (along with Andrew Lang and Tim Perry) to the Philadelphia 76ers for Charles Barkley. With Hersey Hawkins, the Sixers' leading scorer, in the shooting guard position, Hornacek was assigned point guard responsibilities. Although he had a career high 6.9 assists per game in his only complete season with the Sixers (1992–93 season), his stint as a point guard was not a success (26 wins, 56 losses). Midway through the 1993–94 season (February 24) he was traded to the Utah Jazz (for Jeff Malone) where he could return to his natural shooting guard position alongside John Stockton. Like in Phoenix, Hornacek was a complementary ""third option"" to Karl Malone and Stockton. Hornacek was also one of the best on offense in the NBA in moving without the ball, something essential for a shooting guard. He was an instrumental part of the Jazz's drive to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, where the Jazz lost to the Chicago Bulls both times. He remained with the Jazz until knee problems forced his retirement in 2000. It was revealed that he has no left meniscus due to wear and tear on his body, so bad that he could have needed knee reconstruction because it also is arthritic.[2] On November 23, 1994, he set a then-NBA record with eight consecutive three-pointers in a single game against the Seattle SuperSonics. That same season, he also tied an NBA record 11 consecutive three-pointers, from December 30, 1994 through January 11, 1995. One of the best free throw shooters in the league, once making 67 in a row (November 12, 1999 – January 6, 2000), one of his most well-known mannerisms was stroking the side of his face three times before every free-throw attempt. That was his way of saying hello to his three children, Tyler, Ryan and Abigaile, during the game.[3] He holds a career free throw percentage of 87.7, 16th highest in NBA history.[4] Hornacek won the NBA three-point competition twice, and along with Natalie Williams, star of the Utah Starzz, won the All-Star 2-Ball Challenge. After the 1999–2000 season, Hornacek retired from basketball to spend more time with his family.[5] Hornacek's No. 14 jersey was retired by the Utah Jazz, for whom he played from 1994 to 2000, and helped get them to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998. Coach Jerry Sloan and Jazz announcer ""Hot Rod"" Hundley referred to Hornacek affectionately as ""Horny"".[6] All in all, Hornacek enjoyed a 14 year NBA playing career including 1077 career games played. He was hired for the 2007–08 season by the Jazz as a special assistant coach and to help Andrei Kirilenko and others with their shooting.[7][8] In May 2008 Hornacek interviewed for a coaching position with the Chicago Bulls, meeting with general manager John Paxson. He put off seeking a coaching position until his children were older so the extensive travel would not put excess pressure on his family.[8] After the departure of Jerry Sloan and Phil Johnson in February 2011, Jeff Hornacek became a full assistant coach with the Utah Jazz.[9] During 2013, Hornacek was considered a head coach candidate for two of his former teams, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns, as well as the Charlotte Bobcats. On May 28, 2013, he was named the head coach of the Phoenix Suns.[10] Hornacek has stated that his coaching style is reminiscent to that of Cotton Fitzsimmons and Sloan, who both coached him back when he played for the coaches' respective teams. Hornacek also coached the Suns' Summer League team during the 2013 season in Las Vegas. In his first game as head coach at the Summer League, he helped lead the team to an 82–69 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. The Suns went on a six-game winning streak before ultimately losing in the inaugural championship round to the Golden State Warriors 91–77. Hornacek was 5–2 in pre-season and he started the 2013–14 NBA season with a 104–91 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers and an 87–84 victory over the Utah Jazz, both times at home. Hornacek also became the team's first ever head coach to start out his coaching stint with a 4–0 record at home games.[citation needed] Hornacek won the NBA Coach of the Month award in December 2013, his first coaching honor, after leading the Suns to a 10–3 record during the month. Hornacek also became the third former NBA player to win both Player of the Month and Coach of the Month awards (after Larry Bird and Larry Drew), and the first coach to receive both awards with the same team.[11] For the season, the Suns improved by 23 victories upon the previous season's record, which led to a 48–34 record in Hornacek's first season as a head coach. This accomplishment lead to the Phoenix Suns becoming the most improved team during the 2013–14 NBA season. Despite the improvement, the Suns still missed the playoffs and Hornacek was the runner-up coach in the NBA Coach of the Year Award receiving 37 1st place votes. He lost to three-time winner Gregg Popovich.[12] On February 1, 2016, Hornacek was fired as head coach of the Phoenix Suns after two-and-a-half seasons in the position.[13] On June 2, 2016, the New York Knicks officially announced Hornacek as their new head coach.[14] His first season in New York held a promising enough start, to the point where the team had a 16–13 record early on. However, malcontent surrounding the Knicks between the front office and some of their players resulted in Hornacek having a 31–51 record by the end of the season. On April 12, 2018, the Knicks fired Hornacek after a 29–53 season.[15] Iowa State University records: NBA totals: Hornacek is of Czech descent.[16] He is the brother-in-law of Phoenix Suns athletic trainer Aaron Nelson.[17] When Joe Proski was the Suns' head athletic trainer, Hornacek recommended Nelson as an assistant for him.[18] Nelson would be his assistant in 1993 before being the head athletic trainer in 2000 onward. Hornacek's father, John, was a high school coach for basketball and baseball at St. Joseph High School in Westchester, Illinois.[19] Hornacek considers his father, alongside Cotton Fitzsimmons and Jerry Sloan, as an influence towards his coaching career. Hornacek married his wife Stacy on June 7, 1986.[20] Jeff and Stacy have three children: Ryan (born 1989), Tyler (born 1990) and Abby (born 1994).[21] Abby became a digital host for the online 120 Sports network in 2016,[22] and joined Fox Nation in 2019.[23] Hornacek is represented by Steve A.

After playing basketball at Murrah High School in Jackson, Mississippi, alongside phenom James Robinson, Hunter enrolled at Alcorn State University, then transferred to Jackson State University after his freshman year. While playing for the Jackson State Tigers, he became arguably the school's highest profile athlete since the days of Walter Payton and Jackie Slater. The Detroit Pistons had two first-round picks in the 1993 NBA draft. They selected Hunter with the 10th pick and chose Tennessee guard Allan Houston with the 11th. Hunter spent most of his professional career playing with the Pistons organization. His first stint in Detroit lasted from 1993 to 2000 when he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Billy Owens.

An outstanding collegian at the University of Kentucky, he was twice named an All-American en route to a still school record 25.7 points per game. The American Basketball Association Rookie of the Year in 1971, he was a six-time ABA All-Star and one-time NBA All-Star. A prolific scorer, Issel remains the all-time leading scorer at the University of Kentucky and second all-time for the NBA's Denver Nuggets and the American Basketball Association itself. Upon his retirement from the NBA in 1985, only Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Julius Erving had scored more professional points.[1] Issel was born in Batavia, Illinois, son of Robert and Elanor Issel, and grew up with sister Kathi and brother Greg. Robert Issel owned and operated Issel Painting & Decorating.[2] Issel attended Batavia High School, graduating in 1967 as an All-American playing for Coach Don Vandersnick.[3] Issel led Batavia to its first Sectional title as a senior, hitting the game-winning shot against Naperville Central High School to win the title. As a senior, Issel averaged 25.8 points on Batavia's 26-3 team.[1] Growing up in Batavia, Issel's backyard met up with his friend Ken Anderson’s back yard. Anderson's father was a janitor at Batavia High School, and the Issel property on Harrison Street backed onto that of the Andersons' on Republic Road.[4] Growing up together, Issel and Anderson rode in Issel's red Ford convertible and frequented the Twin Elms restaurant. Later, Anderson and Issel would co-own a 782 farm in Kentucky.[4] Anderson became a National Football League quarterback with the Cincinnati Bengals and the 1981 NFL Most Valuable Player.[5] Another neighbor and teammate, Byron Von Hoff, played basketball and other sports at Batavia with Anderson and Issel. Von Hoff was the 21st pick of the New York Mets in the 1966 amateur baseball draft and pitched successfully in the minor leagues before an injury ended his career.[6][1] Another teammate at Batavia was future sports announcer Craig Sager, who was a freshman when Issel was a senior.[7][4] Said Issel of his Batavia teammates: “What Batavia instilled in all three of us –– myself, Kenny, and Craig –– was a solid work ethic.""[5] According to Sports Illustrated: Don VanDersnick showed Issel how to dunk by training him with a volleyball and had Issel jump up and grab the rim 50 times each day at practice. Issel did not start for Batavia High's basketball team until he was a junior and considered himself fortunate that he had Don Vandersnick as his coach, saying, ""If he'd told us that if we dove off a water tower it would make us better basketball players, there would have been a line waiting to do it.""[4] Issel was recruited by Northwestern, Illinois and Wisconsin, but he chose Kentucky.[4] Issel then played college basketball at the University of Kentucky under legendary coach Adolph Rupp. As a senior at Kentucky, Issel averaged 33.9 points per game (36.0 in the NCAA Tournament) to help Kentucky reach the Elite Eight.[8] Issel was at UK 1966–1970 and scored 2,138 points (an average of 25.7 per game) and had 1078 rebounds, while being named an All American for two of the three seasons he was eligible for the award. His career points total remains the highest among UK men's players. According to Sports Illustrated Magazine: In a game early in Issel's Kentucky career, teammates were neglecting to give him the ball, so Rupp called a timeout, and said, ""This guy is going to be Kentucky's all-time leading scorer by the time he's through here. I thought you might like to meet him.""[9] On February 7, 1970, Issel scored 53 points in a 120–85 victory over Ole Miss, breaking Cliff Hagan's single-game record of 51. Issel's mark held for almost four decades, until Jodie Meeks scored 54 points against Tennessee on January 13, 2009.[10] Issel also scored 51 at Louisiana State University on February 21, 1970, currently the third-best mark in school history.[11] A three-year starter for Kentucky, Issel led his team to three Southeastern Conference titles and set 23 school records in his career.[12] Upon Issel's graduation in 1970 he was drafted by the Detroit Pistons (8th round) of the National Basketball Association and the Kentucky Colonels (1st round) of the American Basketball Association. Issel signed to play basketball for the Colonels and the ABA. In his first season, Issel led the ABA in scoring with an average of 29.9 points per game, and pulled down 13.2 rebounds per game. He played in the 1971 ABA All-Star Game and was selected to the All-ABA Second Team. Issel shared ABA Rookie of the Year honors with Charlie Scott of the Virginia Squires. The following season, Issel played in 83 of 84 games and raised his scoring average to 30.6 points per game. He was named the MVP of his second All-Star Game for scoring 21 points and collaring nine rebounds. Issel made the All-ABA First Team of that season. Led by dominating 7'2"" center Artis Gilmore, the 1974–75 Kentucky Colonels won the 1975 ABA championship, with key support from Issel and sharp-shooting guard (and fellow ex-Kentucky Wildcat) Louie Dampier. In six seasons, Issel led the league in total points three times (including a record 2,538 in 1971–72) and was an All-Star each year. Prior to the 1975–76 season, the Colonels traded Issel to the Baltimore Claws (formerly the Memphis Hustlers) for Tom Owens and cash. With Claws folding before the season's start, Issel was subsequently traded to the Denver Nuggets for Dave Robisch and cash. For his ABA career, Issel was a 6-Time ABA All-Star, 5-Time Member of ABA All-Pro Team, the ABA's 2nd All-Time Scorer (behind Louie Dampier, was the 1972 ABA All-Star Game MVP, 1971 ABA Co-Rookie of the Year, Led ABA in scoring in 70-71 with 29.4 ppg and holds the ABA Record for most points in a season with 2,538 in 71-72.[13] Issel remained with the Nuggets following the ABA–NBA merger in June 1976, and represented Denver in the 1977 NBA All-Star Game. He remained productive, topping 20 points per game five of his remaining eight years. Retiring following the 1984–1985 season, he received the NBA's J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award in 1985 for his outstanding service to the community. In nine seasons and 718 NBA games with Denver, Issel averaged 20.4 points and 7.9 rebounds per game.[14] Wearing number 44, Issel is the Nuggets' second all-time leading scorer. He accumulated over 27,000 points in his combined ABA and NBA career, trailing only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain and Julius Erving upon his retirement. Issel currently ranks #11 on the all time combined ABA/NBA scoring list. He missed only 24 games in 15 seasons, earning him the moniker, ""the Horse"". He was part of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 1993. After his playing career Issel retired to his Courtland horse farm in Woodford County, Kentucky. He spent a year doing color commentary for Kentucky basketball games then became a Nuggets broadcaster from 1988 to 1992. Even with no coaching experience, Bernie Bickerstaff recruited him as Nuggets head coach in 1992. In 1994, Issel led his team to the playoffs with their first winning record in four years, after only winning 44 games in the previous two years. That year, the Nuggets pulled off the biggest upset to that date in National Basketball Association (NBA) playoff history, knocking off the Seattle SuperSonics in five games (the first ever 8th seed to beat a 1st seed in the first round). He resigned 34 games into the 1994–95 season after facing criticism for his coaching style, saying he didn't like the person he'd become. He returned in 1998 as president and general manager, naming himself head coach again in December 1999, yielding his general manager's title to Kiki Vandeweghe. His second tenure was far less successful; the Nuggets did not post a winning season during this time. He was hampered in part by a drawn-out effort to find a new owner; two deals to sell the team collapsed at the last minute. Just before the start of the 1999–2000 season, he told reporters that there were several decisions he simply couldn't make due to the unstable ownership situation.[15] In 2000, Issel faced a team mutiny after angering his team for criticizing them after a winless four-game Eastern road trip. The Nuggets' team captains called a boycott of their next practice, prompting interest from CNN and other news outlets. The team saw some improvement later in the season, but missed the playoffs with a 40–42 record.[16] His tenure ended on a rather sour note in December 2001. On December 11, after a close loss to the Charlotte Hornets, Issel heard a fan taunting him as he walked off the court at the Pepsi Center. Issel taunted back, ""Go drink another beer, you Mexican piece of shit.""[17] The incident was captured on Denver's NBC affiliate, KUSA-TV. Issel was suspended four games by the team. Issel publicly apologized the next day, and on Friday met with Hispanic chamber representatives, who accepted his apology.[18] However, several members of Denver's Hispanic community thought the suspension was insufficient punishment, and called for him to be fired. Hours before he was due to return, Issel took a leave of absence to decide whether he wanted to return. Issel decided to resign on December 26. Issel's wife Cheri, whom he met at the University of Kentucky, is an accomplished artist. Cheri was a cheerleader at Kentucky, They have two children, Sheridan and Scott.[19][20] Greg Issel, Dan's younger brother, was a star forward on Batavia teams in 1968 and 1969, following Dan. Greg Issel died suddenly of heart failure in 1998 at the age of 46.[21] Issel filed for bankruptcy in 2009, claiming a $4.5 million debt to at least 34 creditors. To defray his debts, he sold off his 1969 Look All-America Kentucky All-Star ring, 1970 Kentucky class ring, a 1975 25th anniversary ABA All-Star ring, and a 1989 NBA All-Star ring.[citation needed] In 2011, Issel lived in Los Angeles where he was executive director at the Bel Air Presbyterian Church.[22] As of 2014, he lives in Windsor, Colorado, employed in the oil and gas business.[23] In 2017, Issel served as speaker at Batavia High School's gymnasium to honor a family friend, fellow Batavia classmate and national sportscaster Craig Sager after Sager's death. Sager and Issel were basketball teammates at Batavia High School, when Sager was a freshman and Issel a senior.[5][7] In February 2018, Issel's ties to the Kentucky Colonels home of Louisville, Kentucky, led him to become President of the Louisville Basketball Investment and Support Group, a Kentucky-based limited liability company founded in 2016 to pursue an NBA franchise.[24] The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Bio of Issel reads:",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/145.png

After retiring from playing basketball, Jackson became a broadcast commentator for ESPN and ABC alongside his former coach Jeff Van Gundy and play-by-play man Mike Breen. He also worked as an analyst for The YES Network's New Jersey Nets games. In 2011 the Golden State Warriors hired Jackson as head coach. He coached the team for three seasons, but was fired in 2014 despite leading the Warriors to consecutive playoff appearances for the first time in over 20 years. On May 17, 2014, Jackson reached a multiyear agreement to return to ESPN as a game analyst.[1] Mark Jackson was born in Brooklyn, New York. He was regarded as one of the nation's elite point guards while attending Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in Brooklyn under coach Patrick Quigley. Jackson gained a reputation as a streetballer in New York and a college hoops star at St. John's University. While at St. John's, he played alongside Olympian and NBA All-Star Chris Mullin for two seasons. He credits Mullin with teaching him the importance of rigorous practice work in the gym.[2] While at St. John's, Jackson had the unusual habit while at the free-throw line of extending his hand and ""cupping"" his thumb and index finger around the rim. This helped him stay focused on the rim while shooting foul shots. He continued this well into his pro career and it helped him to a career 77.0% free-throw percentage. Jackson was the 18th pick of the 1987 NBA draft by the New York Knicks.[3] He teamed with Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley to turn the Knicks into a prime playoff team in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, before the Knicks peaked and became regular playoff contenders, he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in 1992. Jackson had a steady career with the Knicks, most notably under coach Rick Pitino, averaging 13.6 points and 10.6 assists per game in his rookie season, earning him the 1988 Rookie of the Year award, the lowest overall draft pick to win the award since Woody Sauldsberry in 1958. He was the only non-lottery pick to have won the award since the introduction of the system in 1985 until the 2016-17 season, where Malcolm Brogdon won the award as a second round pick. In 1989 Jackson had another promising season for the Knicks, teaming with Ewing to lead them to the Atlantic Division title and the number two seed in the east (behind the eventual world champion Detroit Pistons, whom they swept 4-0 in the regular season), and making his lone All-Star Game appearance. After sweeping Charles Barkley's Philadelphia team in the opening round, the Knicks faced the upstart Chicago Bulls, led by Michael Jordan, in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Noteworthy in the series was near the end of game two, where Jackson en route to a fast break layup in the fourth quarter looked back and stuck out his tongue at Jordan before finishing the layup; Jordan responded with a 40+ PPG average the remainder of the series, and led Chicago to a 4-2 series victory. Following a contract extension prior to the 1990 season, Jackson began to lose his All-Star form; the loss of Pitino (who left to coach the University of Kentucky) and starting the season out of shape were key factors. Consequently, he began to face stiff competition from backup guard Rod Strickland, and then after Strickland was traded away, Maurice Cheeks, to the point where in their decisive first-round game five against Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Dennis Johnson and the Boston Celtics at the Boston Garden, Knick coach Stu Jackson decided to bench Mark Jackson for the entire game; New York went on to defeat Boston to advance to the second round, where they lost to the eventual champion Detroit Pistons in five games. After the 1991–92 season, he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers, a trade that saw Charles Smith and Doc Rivers go to the Knicks (this was actually a three-team deal, with the Clippers also obtaining Stanley Roberts from the Orlando Magic for draft picks; Roberts had become superfluous in Orlando when the Magic won the draft lottery for his college teammate, Shaquille O'Neal.) While with the Clippers, Jackson teamed with Danny Manning, Ron Harper and head coach Larry Brown to lead the Clippers to the second of their two consecutive playoff appearances; the Clippers would not reach the playoffs in consecutive years again until the 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 seasons. On June 30, 1994, the Indiana Pacers traded Pooh Richardson, Malik Sealy, and the draft rights to Eric Piatkowski for Jackson and the draft rights to Greg Minor. With the Pacers, he teamed with Reggie Miller, Rik Smits, Antonio Davis and Dale Davis for six seasons to make the Indiana Pacers a contender. Jackson was traded to the Denver Nuggets before the 1996–97 NBA season started for Jalen Rose. This trade was a disaster for the Pacers, as the Pacers fell in 10th place in the East halfway through the season and out of the playoff race. Looking to re-energize the team's on-court performance, Pacers' president Donnie Walsh traded for Jackson and LaSalle Thompson at the trade deadline, giving up Vincent Askew, Eddie Johnson and second round picks in 1997 and 1998. The return of Jackson sparked the Pacers, but they still missed the playoffs for the only time in the last decade and a half. Jackson would eventually appear in his only NBA Finals as the Pacers' starting point guard in 2000, when they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. Jackson would leave the Pacers that off-season for the Toronto Raptors, who needed a point guard and had extra money to spend due to the departure of Tracy McGrady earlier that off-season. Antonio Davis recommended his former Pacers teammate as a suitable replacement. Jackson would only play 54 games for the Raptors before being traded at the trade deadline back to the Knicks. Jackson was traded to the Knicks, along with Muggsy Bogues (who was later traded to the Dallas Mavericks without playing a game for the Knicks), for Chris Childs on February 22, 2001. Jackson became the starter at point guard for the rest of the season, playing in 29 games. He helped lead the Knicks to the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference, as the Knicks were knocked out of the playoffs by the Raptors. Despite a solid individual season for Jackson, the Knicks ended the 2001–02 season with a 30–52 record and out of the playoffs for the first time in 15 seasons. In the offseason, he was involved in a trade back to the Nuggets in a deal that included Antonio McDyess, after which he was immediately waived. On October 2, 2002, Jackson signed with the Utah Jazz and played for them during the 2002–03 season as John Stockton's backup. It was this season that Jackson moved to second place on the list of all-time assists leaders behind his teammate Stockton. Jackson would play all 82 games that season without starting one. On January 15, 2004, Jackson signed with the Houston Rockets backing up Steve Francis. Jackson played in only 42 games as a Rocket and, experiencing a large drop-off in skills, finished his career at season's end. Jackson ranks 13th on the NBA all-time games list (1,296), 26th on the all-time minutes played list (39,121), 77th on the all-time three-point field goals made list (734), 65th on the all-time three-point field goal attempts list (2,213), 4th on the all-time assists list (10,323) and 23rd on the all-time steals list (1,608). He never achieved great individual success; despite winning Rookie of the Year in 1988, he made only one All-Star appearance in his career (1989). Jackson is also notable for prompting an NBA rule change. In response to his penchant for backing down opposing point guards in the post for 15 or more seconds at a time, the league instituted the five-second back-to-the-basket violation, sometimes called the ""Mark Jackson Rule"", prohibiting an offensive player from dribbling with his back to the basket for more than five consecutive seconds when below the free throw line. Jackson is also known for perfecting and increasing the popularity of the ""teardrop"" shot, which he often used to shoot over much larger defenders. Jackson worked as an analyst for New Jersey Nets on YES Network, mostly with Marv Albert. He has also worked as an analyst for ABC, teaming with Mike Breen and former coach Jeff Van Gundy. At the end of the 2008 NBA season, Jackson unexpectedly quit his position with the YES Network. This move fueled speculation that Jackson would be replacing Isiah Thomas as coach of the New York Knicks, but Jackson said the rumors were untrue and the decision was based on a desire to stop commuting from Los Angeles and his contract with ABC.[4] Still, the rumors persisted until the Knicks hired former Phoenix Suns head coach Mike D'Antoni. On June 6, 2011, Jackson was hired as head coach of the Golden State Warriors. He was the first head coach hired by new owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber. After inheriting a team that had made the playoffs just once in the previous 17 years, Jackson promised to turn the Warriors into a good defensive team and playoff contender,[5] but struggled to a 23–43 record in his first year during the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season as the team suffered several injuries to key players while adjusting to a new system. In the 2012–13 season, with strong performance from Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, Jackson led the Warriors to a 47–35 record and a #6 seed in the Western Conference playoffs. It was the first time the Warriors had made the playoffs since the 2006–07 season. The Warriors defeated the Denver Nuggets 4–2 in the first round, but lost to the San Antonio Spurs 4–2 in the semifinals.[6] Originally signed under a four-year, $8 million contract, Jackson earned two more years guaranteed on his contract in 2013, putting him under contract through 2014–15.[7] The following season, the Warriors improved to 51–31, the team's first season with 50 or more wins since 1993–94.[8] They reached the playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1992, but lost in the first round to the Los Angeles Clippers in seven games. On May 6, 2014, Jackson was removed as head coach of the Warriors. The Warriors' front office said the team was better than when Jackson arrived but felt a different coach was needed to win an NBA championship.[5][9] The following season, head coach Steve Kerr's Warriors won the team's first NBA title in 40 years. Jackson married singer and actress Desiree Coleman on July 29, 1990.[3] They have four children.[10] Jackson and Coleman divorced in 2017 after 27 years of marriage.[11] His son, Mark Jackson, Jr., played for the Manhattan Jaspers[12] for the 2012–13 season after transferring from the University of Louisville.[13] He is the older brother of AND1 streetballer Troy Jackson, better known as ""Escalade"". Troy Jackson died on February 20, 2011, at the age of 38.[14] Jackson is a Christian and a licensed minister.[4][15] He and his wife pastor true Love Worship Center International in Reseda, California.[16] Jackson appeared in 1996's Eddie, playing Darren ""Preacher"" Taylor. Jackson is of partial Dominican descent, which qualified him to play for the country's national basketball team.[17][18] In June 2012 Jackson revealed that he had been the target of an extortion threat based on an extramarital affair and nude photos taken in 2006. Jackson said that he initially made payments of several thousands of dollars to a stripper and her accomplice to keep quiet about the affair and the photos, but when the alleged extortionists increased their demands Jackson went to the FBI, and ultimately the alleged conspirators were named in felony criminal complaints. ""I recognize the extremely poor judgment that I used both in having an affair six years ago—including the embarrassing communication I exhibited during that time,"" said Jackson, ""and in attempting to deal with the extortion scheme at first by myself.""[19]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/146.png
147,Phil Jackson,"September 17, 1945",,"Williston in Williston, North Dakota",University of North Dakota,1990,2011,20,true,,"""[5, 1]""",/coaches/jacksph01c.html,"Philip Douglas Jackson (born September 17, 1945) is an American former professional basketball player, coach, and executive in the National Basketball Association (NBA). A power forward, Jackson played 12 seasons in the NBA, winning NBA championships with the New York Knicks in 1970 and 1973.[1] Jackson was the head coach of the Chicago Bulls from 1989 to 1998, He coached the Bulls to six NBA championships. He then coached the Los Angeles Lakers from 1999 to 2004 and again from 2005 to 2011; the team won five NBA championships under his leadership. Jackson's 11 NBA titles as a coach surpassed the previous record of nine set by Red Auerbach. He also holds the NBA record for the most combined championships, winning a total of 13 as a player and a coach. Jackson is known for his use of Tex Winter's triangle offense as well as a holistic approach to coaching that was influenced by Eastern philosophy, garnering him the nickname ""Zen Master"". Jackson cited Robert Pirsig's book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance as one of the major guiding forces in his life. He also applied Native American spiritual practices, as documented in his book Sacred Hoops.[2] He is the author of several candid books about his teams and his basketball strategies. In 2007, Jackson was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.[3] In 1996, as part of celebrations for the National Basketball Association's 50th anniversary, Jackson was named one of the 10 greatest coaches in league history.[4][5][6][7] Jackson retired from coaching in 2011 and joined the Knicks as an executive in March 2014.[8][9] He was dismissed as the Knicks' team president on June 28, 2017.[10] Jackson was born in Deer Lodge, Montana on September 17, 1945. Both of his parents, Charles and Elisabeth Funk[11] Jackson, were Assemblies of God ministers. Elisabeth came from a long line of German Mennonites before her conversion to the Assemblies of God. In the churches that they served, his father generally preached on Sunday mornings and his mother on Sunday evenings. Eventually, his father became a ministerial supervisor.[11] Phil, his two brothers, and his half-sister grew up in a remote area of Montana in an austere environment, in which no dancing or television was allowed. Jackson did not see his first movie until he was a senior in high school, and went to a dance for the first time in college.[11] Growing up, he assumed he would become a minister. Jackson attended high school in Williston, North Dakota, where he played varsity basketball and led the team to two state titles. He also played football, was a pitcher on the baseball team, and threw the discus in track and field competitions.[11] The high school now has a sports complex named after him.[12] His brother Chuck speculated years later that the three Jackson sons threw themselves passionately into athletics because it was the only time they were allowed to do what other children were doing.[11] Jackson attracted the attention of several baseball scouts. Their notes found their way to future NBA coach Bill Fitch, who had previously coached baseball, and had been doing some scouting for the Atlanta Braves. Fitch took over as head basketball coach at the University of North Dakota in the spring of 1962, during Jackson's junior year of high school.[11] Bill Fitch successfully recruited Jackson to the University of North Dakota, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.[11][13] Jackson did well there, helping the Fighting Sioux to third- and fourth-place finishes in the NCAA Division II tournament in his sophomore and junior years (1965 and 1966). Both years, they were beaten by the Southern Illinois Salukis.[11] Jackson's future Knicks teammate Walt Frazier was the Salukis' biggest star, but the two only faced off in 1965, as Frazier was academically ineligible in 1966. In 1967, Jackson was drafted in the second round by the New York Knicks. While he was a good all-around athlete, with unusually long arms, he was limited offensively and compensated with intelligence and hard work on defense.[11] Jackson eventually established himself as a fan favorite and one of the NBA's leading substitutes, although he had very little playing time. He was a top reserve on the Knicks team that won the NBA title in 1973. Jackson did not play during New York's 1969–70 championship season due to spinal fusion surgery; however, he authored a book entitled Take It All, a photo diary of the Knicks' 1970 championship run. Soon after the 1973 title, several key starters retired, creating an opening for Jackson in the starting lineup.[11] In the 1974–75 NBA season, Jackson and the Milwaukee Bucks' Bob Dandridge shared the lead for total personal fouls, with 330 each.[14] Jackson lived in Leonia, New Jersey, during this time.[15] After going across the Hudson in 1978 to play two seasons for the New Jersey Nets, he retired as a player in 1980. In the years immediately following the end of his playing career, Jackson coached in lower-level professional leagues like the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) and Puerto Rico's National Superior Basketball (BSN). While in the CBA, he won his first coaching championship, leading the Albany Patroons to their first title in 1984. In Puerto Rico, he coached the Piratas de Quebradillas (1984 and 1987) and the Gallitos de Isabela (1984–1986). He regularly sought NBA jobs, but was turned down. Jackson had acquired a reputation for being sympathetic to the counterculture during his playing years, which may have scared off potential NBA employers.[11] In 1987, Jackson was hired as an assistant coach by the Chicago Bulls under Doug Collins. He was promoted to head coach in 1989. It was around this time that he met Tex Winter and became a devotee of Winter's triangle offense.[16][17] Over nine seasons, Jackson coached the Bulls to six championships, winning three straight championships over separate three-year periods. The ""three-peat"" was the first since the Boston Celtics won eight titles in a row from 1959 through 1966. Jackson and the Bulls made the playoffs every year, and failed to win the title only three times. Michael Jordan's first retirement after the 1992–1993 season marked the end of the first ""three-peat"", and although Jordan returned just before the 1995 playoffs, it was not enough to prevent a playoff elimination by the Orlando Magic. Despite the Bulls' success, tension between Jackson and Bulls general manager Jerry Krause grew. Some believed that Krause felt under-recognized for building a championship team and believed that Jackson was indebted to him for giving him his first NBA coaching job. In the summer of 1997, Jackson was not invited to the wedding of Krause's stepdaughter, although all of the Bulls' assistant coaches were, as was Tim Floyd, then head coach at Iowa State, Jackson's eventual successor.[11] After contentious negotiations, Jackson was signed for the 1997–98 season only. Krause announced the signing by emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997–98 title. Jackson then told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side, to which Krause responded, ""I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.""[11] Krause publicly portrayed Jackson as a two-faced character who had very little regard for his assistant coaches. After the Bulls' final title of the Jordan era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again.[18] However, after taking a year off, he decided to give it another chance with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1999. Jackson took over a talented Lakers team and immediately produced results as he did in Chicago. In his first year in Los Angeles, the Lakers went 67–15 during the regular season to top the league. Reaching the conference finals, they eliminated the Portland Trail Blazers in a tough seven-game series and then won the 2000 NBA championship by beating the Indiana Pacers. With the talented superstar duo of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the strong supporting cast of Glen Rice, Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, Devean George, A. C. Green, Robert Horry, and Brian Shaw, and the assistance of former Bulls Horace Grant, Ron Harper, and John Salley, Jackson would lead the Lakers to two additional titles in 2001 and 2002, against the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets, adding up to his third three-peat as head coach. The main serious challenge the Lakers faced was from their conference rival, the Sacramento Kings. However, injuries, weak bench play, and full-blown public tension between Bryant and O'Neal slowed the team down, and they were beaten in the second round of the 2003 NBA Playoffs by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs. Afterward, Jackson clashed frequently with Bryant. While remarkably efficient in Jackson's ""triangle offense"", Bryant had a personal distaste for Jackson's brand of basketball and subsequently called it ""boring"". In games, Bryant would often disregard the set offense completely to experiment with his own one-on-one moves, infuriating the normally calm Jackson. Bryant managed to test Jackson's patience enough that the ""Zen Master"" even demanded that Bryant be traded, although Laker management rejected the request. Prior to the 2003–04 season, the Lakers signed NBA star veterans Karl Malone and Gary Payton, who had been franchise players for the Utah Jazz and the Seattle SuperSonics, respectively, leading to predictions by some that the team would finish with the best record in NBA history. But from the first day of training camp, the Lakers were beset by distractions. Bryant's trial for alleged sexual assault, continued public sniping between O'Neal and Bryant, and repeated disputes between Jackson and Bryant all affected the team during the season. Despite these distractions, the Lakers beat the defending champion Spurs en route to advancing to the 2004 NBA Finals and were heavy favorites to regain the title. However, they were upset by the Detroit Pistons, who used their strong defense to dominate the Lakers, winning the title four games to one. This marked the first time in ten attempts as head coach that Jackson had lost in the NBA Finals. On June 18, 2004, three days after the loss to the Pistons, the Lakers announced that Jackson would leave his position as Lakers coach. Jackson was seeking to double his salary from $6 million to $12 million on his expiring contract. He had a contract offer outstanding from the Lakers, but he had not acted on it.[19] Winter said Jackson announced at the All-Star break that he would not want to return to the Lakers if Bryant returned.[19] Many fans attributed Jackson's departure directly to the wishes of Bryant, as Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss reportedly sided with Bryant. Jackson, Bryant and Buss all denied that Bryant had made any explicit demand regarding Jackson. However, O'Neal, upon hearing General Manager Mitch Kupchak's announcement of the team's willingness to trade O'Neal and its intention to keep Bryant, indicated that he felt the franchise was indeed pandering to Bryant's wishes with the departure of Jackson. O'Neal's trade to the Miami Heat was the end of the ""Trifecta"" that had led the Lakers to three championship titles. That fall, Jackson released The Last Season, a book which describes his point of view of the tensions that surrounded the 2003–04 Lakers team. The book was pointedly critical of Kobe Bryant. Without Jackson and O'Neal, the Lakers were forced to become a faster paced team on the court. Though they achieved some success in the first half of the season, injuries to several players including Kobe Bryant and Lamar Odom forced the team out of contention, going 34–48 in 2004–05 and missing the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. Rudy Tomjanovich, Jackson's successor as coach, resigned midway through the season after coaching just 41 games, citing health issues not relating to his past bout with bladder cancer, which immediately led to speculation that the Lakers might bring Jackson back. On June 15, 2005, the Lakers rehired Jackson. Jackson led the Lakers to a seventh-seed playoff berth. Once again promoting the notion of selfless team play embodied by the triangle offense, the team achieved substantial results, especially in the last month of the season. Jackson also worked seamlessly with Bryant, who had earlier shown his desire to bring back Jackson to the bench. Bryant's regular-season performance won him the league scoring title and made him a finalist in MVP voting. However, the Lakers faced a tough 2006 first-round matchup against the second-seeded Phoenix Suns, who were led by eventual MVP winner Steve Nash. It was the first time that Jackson's team had failed to reach the second round of the playoffs. The Lakers jumped out to a 3–1 lead following a dramatic last second shot by Bryant in overtime to win game four, but the Suns recovered to win the last three and take the series. On January 7, 2007, Jackson won his 900th game, then placing him 9th on the all-time win list for NBA coaches. With this win, Jackson became the fastest to reach 900 career wins, doing so in only 1,264 games and beating Pat Riley's previous record of 900 in 1,278 games. On December 12, 2007, after announcing he would return to his position as coach just a few days prior, Jackson inked a 2-year contract extension to continue his tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers through the end of the 2009–2010 season. During the 2007–08 season, the Lakers were able to obtain Pau Gasol in a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies. With another star to pair with Bryant, Jackson coached the Lakers to an appearance in the 2008 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. Boston went on to win the series 4–2, in the process handing Jackson and the Lakers their worst playoff loss ever in Game 6, a 39-point defeat. It was only the 2nd time in 11 appearances that Jackson had lost an NBA Finals. On December 25, 2008, Jackson became the sixth coach to win 1,000 games, with the Lakers defeating the Celtics in their first matchup since the last year's finals. He was the fastest to win 1,000 games, surpassing Pat Riley, who had taken 11 more games than Jackson. Jackson again coached the Lakers to the NBA Finals in 2009, defeating the Utah Jazz, Houston Rockets, and Denver Nuggets in the process. In the Finals, the Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic 4–1, clinching Jackson's 10th NBA championship as head coach and surpassing the record for most championships won by a head coach previously held by him and Red Auerbach. On February 3, 2010, Jackson recorded his 534th win as Lakers head coach, surpassing Pat Riley to become the most successful coach in franchise history. The Lakers would go on to a fifth consecutive playoff berth in 2010. They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, Utah Jazz, and Phoenix Suns in the playoffs before defeating the Boston Celtics in the 2010 NBA Finals, earning Jackson his eleventh NBA championship as head coach and his fifth with the Lakers.[20] He tied original Lakers head coach John Kundla's record for most NBA championships won by a head coach in Lakers franchise history. On July 1, 2010, Jackson, after giving it tremendous thought and consulting with his doctors over health concerns, announced that he would return to coach the Lakers for the 2010–11 season.[21] On August 2, 2010, Jackson signed a new contract with the Lakers to return for what he mentioned was ""his last stand"", meaning the 2010–11 season would be his last. In January 2011, he reiterated that it would be his final season, explaining that in the past there was the possibility that maybe he would reconsider. ""This year, there's no maybe"", said Jackson.[22] He retired after the Lakers were swept out of the playoffs in the conference semifinals by that season's eventual NBA champions, the Dallas Mavericks, meaning that he would not get a fourth three-peat (after previously achieving that feat in 1993, 1998 and 2002).[23][24] In his final news conference that season, he noted that he did not have much of a relationship with Jerry or Jim Buss, and said, ""When I leave here, I don't anticipate Lakers management will call me up and ask my advice.""[25] After the Lakers fired Jackson's successor, Mike Brown, early in the 2012–13 season, they first approached Jackson to replace Brown. Jackson requested two days to consider the opening. He believed the Lakers would wait for his response, but the Lakers thought it was understood they would continue their search. The next day, the team talked with Mike D'Antoni and hired him in a unanimous decision by the front office.[26][27][28][29] They felt D'Antoni's fast-paced style of play made him a ""great fit"" for the team, more suitable than Jackson's structured triangle offense.[26][27][30][31] Jerry Buss' preference has always been for the Lakers to have a wide-open offense.[26] In the two games leading up to D'Antoni's signing, Lakers fans at Staples Center had chanted ""We Want Phil!""[26] In 2014, Jackson was in discussions for months with the New York Knicks regarding an executive position with the team.[32] On March 18, he was introduced as the president of the Knicks after signing a five-year, $60 million contract.[33][34] On April 21, 2014, over one week after the conclusion of the season, Mike Woodson and his entire staff were fired by Jackson.[35] The Knicks finished the season with a 37–45 record and finished 9th in the Eastern Conference standings. On June 9, 2014, the Knicks hired Derek Fisher as the head coach. Fisher played under Phil Jackson as a Laker and won five championships together. On June 25, 2014, the Knicks traded guard Raymond Felton along with former NBA Defensive Player of the Year Tyson Chandler to the Dallas Mavericks. In return the Knicks received Shane Larkin, José Calderón, Samuel Dalembert, and Wayne Ellington along with two picks for the following day's draft. The trade was the first one that he executed as a front office executive. On June 26, as part of the 2014 NBA draft, the Knicks selected Cleanthony Early as the 34th overall pick and Thanasis Antetokounmpo as the 51st overall pick, using the draft picks received in the trade from the Mavericks. The Knicks also acquired Louis Labeyrie, an additional second-round draft pick, after he was traded by the Pacers. On January 7, 2015, the Knicks set a franchise record with 13 straight losses. The Knicks fell 101–91 to the Washington Wizards, giving New York its longest losing streak in the franchise's 69-year history.[36] This record was extended to 16 straight losses after the NBA Global Games loss against the Milwaukee Bucks in London. They ended the season with a record of 17–65, which is the worst record in franchise history. On June 25, 2015, The Knicks drafted Latvian Kristaps Porziņģis with the fourth overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft;[37][38] he signed his rookie-scale contract with the Knicks on July 30, 2015.[39] On that same night, the Knicks traded Tim Hardaway Jr. for the 19th pick in the draft, which would become Jerian Grant.[40] Porziņģis was an NBA All-Rookie First Team selection for the 2016 season. In the 2017 NBA Draft, Jackson's last NBA Draft with the Knicks, he selected French point guard Frank Ntilikina. In the second round, Jackson selected Damyean Dotson and Ognjen Jaramaz. On June 28, 2017, the Knicks officially announced a mutual decision to part ways with Jackson.[41] The speculated reasoning for the parting of ways was Jackson's attempted buying-out of Carmelo Anthony and his very public strife with Porziņģis.[42] Jackson's position would be replaced by his former subordinate Steve Mills. In 1996, Jackson won the NBA Coach of the Year Award. In the same year he was named one of the ten greatest NBA coaches of all time by vote in an unranked compilation.[7][9] At the time he was in his 8th year coaching; in the seven years prior he coached 574 games and won 414, with only 160 losses, and had a win-loss percentage of 72.1% – the highest of any coach on the list at that time. He continued his success in his later career; cumulative careers in perspective, he retains the highest win-loss percentage of any coach on this list at 70.4% (1155 wins, 485 losses).[4] In 2002 and 2010 the United States Sports Academy awarded Jackson the Amos Alonzo Stagg Coaching Award.[43][44] Jackson is a recipient of the state of North Dakota's Roughrider Award. Jackson has had a winning record every year as a head coach, and currently has the highest winning percentage of any Hall of Fame coach, and further the highest of any NBA coach coaching 500 games or more. Along with his NBA-record eleven championships, he is the only coach to win at least ten championships in any of North America's major professional sports. At the end of the 2010 season he had the fifth most wins of any NBA coach, and was one of only six to have over 1,000 wins. Of those six he was the only one who had not coached over 1,900 games, and likewise the only one not included in the top ten total games coached.[45] Jackson has five children (Brooke, Chelsea, Elizabeth, Ben, and Charlie) and eight grandchildren.[46][47] He married his first wife, Maxine, in 1967.

He married his second wife, June, in 1974, but they also divorced.[48] He dated Jeanie Buss, the daughter of Lakers owner Jerry Buss, whom he met in 1999.[49] The two became engaged in 2013.[50] On December 27, 2016, they announced the termination of their engagement in a joint statement on Twitter. Jackson owns homes in Playa del Rey, Los Angeles, and Lakeside, Montana.[51] While he was coach of the Chicago Bulls he lived in Bannockburn.[52] Jackson has admitted to using marijuana and LSD in the past.[53] In 2010, he said he did not believe that prisons should be filled with people prosecuted for marijuana, but called California's Proposition 19, which would have legalized marijuana, poorly written.[54] In a 1990 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Jackson said that he did not care for preachers who browbeat the audience, describing his religious views as ""I’ve always liked the concept of God being beyond anything that the human mind can conceive. I think there is a pantheistic-deistic-American Indian combination religion out there for Americans. That rings true to me.""[55] Jackson was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March 2011. He told the Lakers players in May 2011, when they were involved in a second-round playoff series against the Mavericks. Jackson decided to delay his surgery until after the playoffs.[56]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/147.png

Undrafted in the 1992 NBA draft, Jent was drafted in the fourth round (50th overall) in the 1992 CBA draft.[3] Jent began his professional career with CBA teams Rapid City Thrillers and Columbus Horizon.[4] He had a brief career in the NBA, playing three games each for the Houston Rockets (winning a championship ring in 1994) and New York Knicks (1996–97).[5] He played in 11 playoff games in 1994, thus giving him the rare distinction of having played in more career playoff-games than regular-season games in the NBA.

He most recently served as head coach of the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA) for three years. He was the head coach of the Dakota Wizards from 2000–2004 and 2006–2007 in the International Basketball Association, Continental Basketball Association, and the NBA Development League, winning championships in 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2007. He also coached the Sioux Falls Skyforce from 2004–2006, winning a championship in 2005, and served as head coach of the Memphis Grizzlies of the NBA from 2013 to 2016. After a playing career at Concordia College and Moorhead State (now known as Minnesota State University Moorhead),[2] Joerger joined the Dakota Wizards of the International Basketball Association as the team's general manager.[3] He became the team's assistant coach in 1997 and eventually took over as the head coach for the 2000–01 IBA season. Joerger had immediate success as a head coach, leading his team to a 30–10 regular season record. After being down 0–2 in the IBA Finals best-of-5 series, the Wizards came back to defeat the Des Moines Dragons 3–2, winning their first championship.[4] Joerger remained with the Wizards as IBA, IBL, and CBA teams merged to create the new Continental Basketball Association after the league declared bankruptcy under the ownership of Isiah Thomas. As a former IBA team, the Wizards were declared ""lower-tier"" in the 2001–02 season and were given a shorter schedule with two other former IBA teams and an expansion team to make up the National Conference. With Joerger at the helm, the Wizards finished with a league-leading 26–14 record. For his success, Joerger was named the CBA Coach of the Year. After sweeping the Fargo-Moorhead Beez 3–0 in the conference finals, Joerger won his first CBA championship as his team defeated the Rockford Lightning 116–109 in a winner-take-all championship game.[5] Joerger continued to have success with the Wizards in the CBA, reaching the conference finals with a league-leading 31–17 regular season record in 2002–03 before losing to the Yakima Sun Kings 3–1.[6] Throughout the 2003–04 season, Joerger lost six players to NBA call-ups, which included Sean Lampley, Oliver Miller, Kaniel Dickens, Maurice Carter, Eddie Gill, and Rodney Buford.[7] Despite losing talent, Joerger still managed to coach his team to a league-best 34–14 regular season record, and was again named the CBA Coach of the Year.[8] With Dickens and Carter back from the NBA, the Wizards defeated the Rockford Lightning 3–1 in the semi-finals and won their second CBA championship with a 132–129 victory over the Idaho Stampede.[9] Following another championship season and a stint with the USBL's Cedar Rapids River Raiders,[10] Joerger left the Wizards for an opportunity to coach the Sioux Falls Skyforce. With the Skyforce, a franchise that had missed the play-offs the past few seasons, Joerger had immediate success, guiding them to a 31–17 record and faced off against his former assistant, Casey Owens, and the Dakota Wizards in the conference finals. In 5 games, the Skyforce came out on top and went on to defeat the Rockford Lightning 3–1 for the 2004–05 CBA championship.[11] In the 2005–06 season, despite going 2–0 in a round-robin playoff format based on quarter point percentage, Joerger missed out on just his second championship as a head coach after a 30–18 regular season. In April 2006, the Skyforce, the Wizards, and the Idaho Stampede made the jump from the CBA to the NBA Development League.[12] In May, Joerger left the Skyforce and returned to the Wizards as the head coach once again. As expected, Joerger had immediate success in the D-League, guiding the Wizards to a league-best 33–17 record. After a first round bye, Joerger's team knocked off the Skyforce 115–113 in a one-and-done semi-final and went on to defeat the Colorado 14ers 129–121 in a classic overtime championship game.[13] With five minor league championships under his belt, the National Basketball Association finally took notice and Joerger was hired by the Memphis Grizzlies as an assistant coach for the 2007–08 season under head coach Marc Iavaroni. In 2011, under Lionel Hollins, Joerger was promoted to lead assistant and took over as the team's defense specialist. The Grizzlies improved in defensive efficiency from 24th overall in 2010 to 9th in 2011, 7th in 2012, and 2nd in 2013.[14] On June 10, 2013, the Grizzlies organization announced that Lionel Hollins would not be returning as the team's head coach, despite reaching the conference finals for the first time in franchise history.[15] On June 27, 2013, Joerger was hired as the Grizzlies' head coach for the 2013–14 season.[16] In his first year, Joerger was named the Western Conference Coach of the Month in both January and April.[17][18] On May 28, 2014, it was announced that Joerger was signed to a 3-year contract extension.[19] On May 7, 2016, Joerger was fired by the Grizzlies after three seasons as the team's head coach.[20] On May 9, 2016, just two days after being fired by the Grizzlies, Joerger signed with the Sacramento Kings to become their head coach.[21] On April 11, 2019, the Kings fired Joerger after the team failed to reach the playoffs in three seasons under Joerger; in his last season as coach, the Kings had their best record since they last reached the playoffs in the 2005-06 season.[22][23]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/152.png

Johnson spent 16 years in the National Basketball Association as a player, and subsequently served as the head coach of two NBA teams: the Dallas Mavericks and New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets. He led the Mavericks to their first NBA Finals appearance and to three consecutive 50+ win seasons. During his playing days, Johnson was known as the ""Little General"" for his small stature (by NBA standards), his leadership skills as a point guard (floor general), and his close friendship with former San Antonio Spurs teammate David Robinson - himself nicknamed ""The Admiral"" based on his tenure at the Naval Academy. As a high school senior in 1983, Johnson led New Orleans' St. Augustine High School to a 35–0 record and the Class 4A Louisiana State Championship. Johnson matriculated at New Mexico Junior College before moving on to Cameron University, and finally Southern University, at which in his senior season in 1988 he led NCAA Division I with 13.3 assists per game, an all-time record.[1] In that season, he also averaged 11.4 points per game, making him the first men's Division I player ever to average double figures in points and assists in the same season—a feat that was not duplicated until Jason Brickman of LIU Brooklyn did so in 2013–14.[2] Upon graduation in 1988, Johnson was not selected in the NBA draft.[3] Johnson spent the summer of 1988 with the Palm Beach Stingrays of the United States Basketball League. In 43 games, Johnson averaged 1.6 points and 1.7 assists as a reserve. Johnson also played in six playoff games for the Stingrays.[4] In the 1989–90 season, Johnson played 53 games with 10 starts for the Seattle SuperSonics. He made 18 assists on January 5, 1990 against the Miami Heat.[4] On October 24, 1990, the SuperSonics traded Johnson to the Denver Nuggets for a conditional pick in the 1997 NBA draft. After playing 21 games, Johnson was waived from the Nuggets in December before signing with the San Antonio Spurs on January 17, 1991. Johnson played 47 games with seven starts for the Spurs and averaged 9.4 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists.[4] In the beginning of the 1991–92 season, Johnson played 20 games and averaged 5.0 points and 6.8 assists for the Spurs before being waived in December. On January 10, 1992, Johnson signed the first of several 10-day contracts with the Houston Rockets that preceded a longer-term contract. Johnson scored a then-career-high 22 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves on January 28.[4] Signed as an unrestricted free agent, Johnson returned to the Spurs on November 19, 1992. Promoted to starter, Johnson averaged 8.7 points, 1.9 rebounds, and 7.5 assists and improved his field goal percentage to .502 in 75 games. In the playoffs, Johnson averaged 8.2 points and 8.1 assists.[4] Johnson signed with the Golden State Warriors on October 25, 1993 and was named team captain just nine days into his signing. Starting 70 of 82 games, Johnson reached a new career high 10.9 points per game along with 5.3 assists per game.[4] Johnson is best known for his time with the Spurs from 1994 to 2001, and particularly his integral role on the 1998–99 Spurs team that won the NBA championship against the New York Knicks. Most notably, Johnson made the go-ahead, championship-clinching shot in Game 5 on a jumper with 47 seconds remaining in the game.[5] The Spurs retired Johnson's number 6 on December 22, 2007.[6] He was also inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame on February 20, 2009.[7] On July 19, 2001, Johnson signed as a free agent with the Denver Nuggets. Johnson played 51 games (13 starts) with the Nuggets and averaged 9.4 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 5.1 assists.[8] The Nuggets traded Johnson and three other players to the Dallas Mavericks on February 21, 2002. Johnson played 17 games all as a reserve with the Mavericks for the rest of the season.[8] In the 2002–03 season, Johnson played in 48 games as a reserve for the Mavericks, averaging 9.0 minutes per game. Johnson ended his NBA career in the 2003–04 season back with the Golden State Warriors. He played 46 games with one start and averaged 4.6 points, 0.7 rebounds, and 2.4 assists.[8] On October 28, 2004, Johnson retired from playing and signed as an assistant coach with the Dallas Mavericks under Don Nelson. Johnson had played under Nelson from 2001 to 2003, and it was understood from the beginning that he was being groomed to eventually succeed Nelson as head coach. His transition from assistant to head coach came five months later on March 19, 2005, after Nelson resigned. Under Johnson, the Mavericks closed out the 2004–05 season with a 16–2 run and a first-round playoff victory over the Houston Rockets, before being eliminated by the Phoenix Suns in the second round of the playoffs. Johnson was named the April 2005 NBA Coach of the Month, only one month after becoming a head coach for the first time. The 2005–06 season was even more successful for Johnson and was marked by a series of milestones. In November 2005, Johnson won his second NBA Coach of the Month award (which was also his second consecutive award, following the one he had won in April the previous season), making him the first NBA coach to win the award in his first two months as a head coach. On January 28, 2006, when the Dallas Mavericks defeated the Utah Jazz, Johnson's record as head coach improved to 50–12, making Johnson the fastest coach to reach 50 wins. In February 2006, he was chosen to coach the 2006 NBA All-Star team for the Western Conference. Although Johnson ultimately led the Mavericks to the second-best record in the Western Conference, the team entered the playoffs as the fourth seed in the West due to the structure of the 2006 NBA Playoffs seeding. In April 2006, Johnson was rewarded for his success throughout the season with the 2006 NBA Coach of the Year Award. In June 2006, after defeating the Memphis Grizzlies, the defending champion San Antonio Spurs, and the Phoenix Suns in the first three rounds of the playoffs, Johnson led the Mavericks to their first ever NBA Finals appearance. However, the Mavs were defeated in six games by the Miami Heat, losing four straight after winning the first two games. On December 31, 2006, Johnson became the fastest head coach (at the time) to win 100 games when his squad defeated the Denver Nuggets. This record was later broken by Tom Thibodeau and the Chicago Bulls. In the 2006–07 season, Johnson's Mavericks had the best record in the NBA with 67 wins and entered the playoffs as the top seed. However, his Mavericks lost to the eighth-seeded Golden State Warriors, led by former Mavericks head coach Don Nelson, in one of the biggest upsets in recent NBA history. With the Mavs' win over the Grizzlies on November 18, 2007, Johnson became the fastest coach to reach 150 wins. Following the 2007–08 season, the Mavericks under Johnson were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the second year in a row. A day later, on April 30, 2008, Johnson was dismissed as head coach of the Mavericks and replaced by former NBA Coach of the Year, Rick Carlisle.[9][10][11] On October 17, 2008, Johnson joined ESPN as a studio analyst. He remained in that role for two seasons, until he received an offer to become head coach of the New Jersey Nets.[12] On June 10, 2010, Johnson was hired as head coach of the New Jersey Nets,[13] which had just finished a dismal 2009–10 campaign with a 12–70 record. In his first year as coach of the Nets, the team improved slightly, doubling its win total from the previous season and finishing 24–58. However, the next year saw no such improvement, as his team went 22–44 in the lockout-shortened season. Johnson remained with the Nets when the team moved to Brooklyn in 2012. He was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for October and November 2012 following an 11–4 start to the season. Despite that early success, the team went on to lose ten of its next 13 games, and subsequently Johnson was fired from his head coaching position on December 27, 2012.[14][15] In 2013, Johnson rejoined ESPN to appear as an analyst on SportsCenter, NBA Coast to Coast, and NBA Tonight.[16] On April 5, 2015, ESPN reported that Johnson had verbally agreed to become the new head basketball coach at the University of Alabama, replacing Anthony Grant.[17] The following day, the university officially announced Johnson's hiring as the school's 21st men's basketball coach.[18] After losing in the first round of the 2019 National Invitation Tournament, Alabama and Johnson agreed to mutually part ways.[19] Johnson and his wife Cassandra have two children, Avery Jr. and Christianne.[20] Avery Jr. played for the Alabama basketball team, coached by his father.[21]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/153.png

He was an alumnus of Dominguez High School, Los Angeles Harbor College and Pepperdine University.[1] A prototypical late bloomer, Johnson overcame early struggles[2] and had a successful NBA playing career. Drafted 29th overall in 1976 by the Seattle SuperSonics, Johnson began his professional career as a shooting guard. He eventually led the Sonics to their only NBA championship in 1979, winning the Finals MVP Award. After a short stint with the Phoenix Suns, he became the starting point guard for the Boston Celtics, with whom he won two more championships. Johnson was voted into five All-Star Teams, one All-NBA First and one Second Team, and nine consecutive All-Defensive First and Second Teams.[3] Apart from his reputation as a defensive stopper, Johnson was known as a clutch player who made several decisive plays in NBA playoffs history.[1] The Celtics franchise has retired Johnson's #3 jersey, which hangs from the rafters of the TD Garden, the home arena of the team. On April 5, 2010, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame officially announced that Johnson had been posthumously elected to the Hall. He was formally inducted on August 13.[4] He is considered by several sports journalists to be one of the most underrated players of all time.[5][6][7] Dennis Wayne Johnson was born the eighth of sixteen children, to a social worker and a bricklayer who lived in Compton, California, a suburb of Los Angeles.[1] Originally a baseball fan and a Little Leaguer,[2] Johnson learned basketball from his father, but seemed to have neither the size nor the talent to compete with his peers: as a teenager at Dominguez High School, Johnson measured just 5'9"" and played only ""a minute or two each game"".[1] After high school, he worked several odd jobs, including a $2.75-per-hour job as a forklift driver, and played with his brothers in summer league games after work. During this period, Johnson grew to a height of 6'3"",[2] and developed what some later described as ""rocket launcher legs"", which enabled him to jump high to grab rebounds against taller opponents.[1] Jim White, the coach at Los Angeles Harbor College, had watched Johnson play street basketball; feeling that Johnson excelled in defense, White asked him to enroll.[2] Johnson gave up his jobs and developed into a promising young guard, averaging 18.3 points and 12.0 rebounds per game and leading Harbor to a college junior state title.[1] However, the young guard lacked discipline, often clashed with White and was thrown off the team three times in two years.[2] At the end of his junior college career, two universities offered Johnson scholarships: Azusa Pacific University and Pepperdine University.[1] Johnson chose the latter, and in his only year there, he averaged 15.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game,[3] and developed a reputation for tough defense. After that year, Johnson made himself eligible for the 1976 NBA draft, but was skeptical that any team would take him.[1] NBA teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues,[2] and Johnson was known to be a troublemaker. The Seattle SuperSonics took Johnson in the second round of the 1976 draft with the 29th pick and gave him a four-year contract, with which he earned a salary of $45,000 in the first year and $90,000 in the last.[8] In his rookie year, the 1976–77 NBA season, Johnson, playing backup to the experienced Sonics backcourt tandem of Slick Watts and Fred Brown, averaged 9.2 points and 1.5 assists per game.[3] The Sonics finished with a 40–42 record[9] and missed the 1977 NBA Playoffs, leading head coach Bill Russell to resign.[1] In the following season, the team lost 17 of the first 22 games under Russell's replacement Bob Hopkins, who was replaced by Hall of Fame coach Lenny Wilkens, who gave Johnson a starting spot and paired him with Gus Williams.[1] Johnson revelled in this new role, improving his averages to 12.7 points and 2.8 assists per game.[3] During this period Johnson played shooting guard and was known for his aggressive slam dunking, in contrast to the more cerebral roles he played later in his career.[5] It was at this time that Johnson's nickname ""DJ"" was coined by play-by-play announcer Bob Blackburn, to help distinguish him from teammates, John Johnson and Vinnie Johnson (whom Blackburn referred to as ""JJ"" and ""VJ"", respectively).[10] Finishing strongly, the Sonics ended the regular season with a 47–35 record and made the 1978 NBA Playoffs. After eliminating the Los Angeles Lakers, the defending champion Portland Trail Blazers, and the Denver Nuggets, they almost defeated the Washington Bullets by taking a 3–2 lead in the 1978 NBA Finals. In a 93–92 Game 3 victory, Johnson blocked seven shots—the most blocks in NBA Finals history for a guard.[11][12] The Sonics lost in seven games, however, partly because of Johnson's Game 7 scoring drought, in which the second-year guard missed all of his 14 field goal attempts.[8] Johnson later acknowledged that he simply ""choked""; he vowed never to repeat this again and credited this game as an important lesson to become a better player.[2] Johnson and the Sonics got their revenge in the 1978–79 season. After clinching the Pacific Division with a 52–30 record,[9] the team met the Bullets again in the 1979 NBA Finals. After losing Game 1, the Sonics won the next four games to take the finals series, helped by Johnson who averaged almost 23 points along with six rebounds and assists per game.[13] He scored 32 points in a Game 4 overtime victory, and was named NBA Finals MVP.[1] It was during this season that Johnson established himself as one of the best guards in the league; he averaged 15.9 points and 3.5 assists per game, and made his first All-Defensive First Team and All-Star Game appearance.[3] During the following season, Johnson averaged 19.0 points and 4.1 assists, appeared in his second All-Star Game and was named to the All-Defensive First Team and All-NBA Second Team.[3] The Sonics, however, lost in the Western Conference Finals to the Lakers, who had Hall of Famers Jamaal Wilkes, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Because of the abundance of talent on the Sonics team, Johnson later called this loss one of the worst disappointments of his professional career. Coach Wilkens grew tired of Johnson, who often clashed with him and was perceived as a growing liability to the team.[2][14] At the end of the season, Johnson was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Paul Westphal and draft picks. The Sonics finished 22 games worse in the next season despite the addition of Westphal.[5] Johnson further established himself as a quality player in Phoenix. In his three years as a Sun, Johnson averaged 14–20 points a game and provided tough defense. He played in two All-Star Games, was voted into three consecutive All-Defensive First Teams and earned his only All-NBA First Team appearance.[3] In this period Johnson, like in Seattle, played shooting guard and became the main scorer on the team, as opposed to being the second or third option as a Sonic.[5] In the first two years of Johnson's stint, the Suns were fairly successful, reaching the Western Conference Semifinals both seasons. The Suns bowed out in the first round in Johnson's last year.[15] Johnson's situation deteriorated towards the end of his career at Phoenix. Like in Seattle, he often clashed with his coach, John MacLeod, and finally was traded by general manager, Jerry Colangelo, to the Boston Celtics for Rick Robey and draft picks.[2] Like Seattle after Johnson's departure, the Suns finished 12 games worse in the next season despite the addition of Robey.[5] Between the 1979–80 season and the 1981–82 season, the Celtics had lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals two out of three times, mainly because physical Sixers guard Andrew Toney routinely caused problems for their defensively fragile backcourt. After subsequently getting swept by the Bucks in the 1982–83 Eastern Conference Semifinals, Celtics general manager Red Auerbach added the perennial All-Defensive Team member Johnson to his squad, hoping that Johnson would help the Celtics fare better in the Eastern Conference playoffs (particularly against the 76ers).[5] Johnson joined a squad that included Hall of Fame forwards Larry Bird and Kevin McHale and Hall of Fame center Robert Parish, a trio that has been described as the best NBA frontcourt of all time.[16][17][18][19] Johnson described joining the Celtics as a ""dream come true"" and enjoyed the tutelage of highly successful general manager Auerbach, who was ""living history"" according to Johnson.[2] With the Celtics Johnson changed his playing style for the third time in his career: after being known as a slam dunking shooting guard with the Sonics, and an all-around scorer with the Suns, he now established himself as a point guard who was defined more by playmaking than scoring.[5] In his first year as a Celtic, he averaged 13.2 points and 4.2 assists and was elected to the All-Defensive Second Team.[3] The Celtics reached the 1984 NBA Finals, where they met the Los Angeles Lakers, their intense rivals since the 1960s. The Celtics won 4–3, and Johnson took credit for playing smothering defense on Hall of Fame Lakers playmaker Earvin Johnson, limiting him to a sub-average 17 points in the last four games,[5] and being at least partly responsible for several of the Laker point guard's game-deciding errors in Games 2, 4 and 7. As a result, Magic Johnson was taunted as ""Tragic Johnson"" whenever the Lakers and Celtics played against each other.[20] In the 1984–85 season, Johnson continued playing smothering defense, earning his next All-Defensive Second Team call-up while averaging 16.9 points and 7.3 assists per game.[3] The Celtics met the Lakers in the 1985 NBA Finals again. Johnson's big moment came in Game 4: when the score was tied at 105, teammate Larry Bird had the ball in the last seconds. Being double-teamed by Lakers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, Bird passed to the open Johnson, and the guard sank a 19-ft buzzer beater to win the game.[8] The Lakers, however, took their revenge this time, winning the series in six games, powered by venerable 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar. Johnson described this loss as one of the toughest in his career, because the Celtics were ""close [to winning the series]"", but ""could not get the job done"".[2] In the following season the Celtics made the playoffs, helped by the performance of Johnson, who made the All-Defensive Second Team again while tallying 17.8 points and 6.7 assists per game.[3] After defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics reached the 1986 NBA Finals against the up-and-coming Houston Rockets, led by the ""Twin Towers"" of centers Ralph Sampson and Hakeem Olajuwon. Led by Finals MVP Larry Bird, the Celtics beat the Rockets 4–2, and Johnson won his third title.[21] The Celtics were unable to repeat their title in 1987 despite several dramatic playoff victories. Johnson played strong defense again, earning yet another appearance on the All-Defensive First Team,[3] and the Celtics embarked on a nail-biting playoff campaign. In the 1987 Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Celtics split the first six games against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the deciding Game 7, which the Celtics won, Johnson had a spectacular play with 1:30 left in the game: a Celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds, but Johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in mid-air against Bucks center and former Sonics teammate Jack Sikma. The ball bounced off Sikma before going out of bounds, and the Celtics maintained possession.[5] In the next round the 1987 Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics faced the Detroit Pistons. The series was described as a grudge match between two intense rivals, featuring a great level of personal animosity, sharp rhetoric, and several physical altercations. The center of this feud was Pistons pivot Bill Laimbeer, who brawled with Celtics players Bird and Parish.[22] In Game 5 Johnson was involved in a crucial play: down 107-106, Larry Bird stole the in-bounds pass by Pistons point guard Isiah Thomas with 5 seconds left and passed it to a sprinting Johnson, who converted a difficult layup with 1 second left in the game.[1] This play caused Celtics broadcaster Johnny Most to shout out one of his most famous calls:[23] According to Johnson this was his favorite play of all-time.[2] Games 6 and 7 also featured a feud, this time between Pistons forward Dennis Rodman and Johnson. In Game 6, which the Pistons won, Rodman taunted Johnson in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head. When the Celtics took Game 7, Johnson went back at Rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture.[5] In the 1987 NBA Finals, however, the Celtics succumbed to the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2 as Lakers playmaker and Finals MVP Magic Johnson put up a great performance, averaging 26 points and 13 assists throughout the series.[20][24] The next three seasons were disappointing for the aging Celtics. In the 1987–88 season, Johnson averaged 12.6 points and 7.8 assists,[3] but in the 1988 Playoffs, the Celtics were unable to beat the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals.[21] In the next season, Johnson (who statistically declined to 10.0 points and 6.6 assists per game)[3] and his team made the 1989 NBA Playoffs on a meager 42–40 record (largely due to the absence of star forward Larry Bird for almost the entire season), but were immediately eliminated in the first round (again, largely due to the absence of the injured Larry Bird.)[21] The following 1989–90 NBA season was Johnson's last. The now 35-year-old playmaker relinquished his starting point guard role to younger John Bagley, but when Bagley dislocated his shoulder, Johnson returned with a high level of performance and was lovingly called ""our glue man"" by coach Jimmy Rodgers.[25][26] In that season, Johnson started in 65 of his 75 games, averaging 7.1 points and 6.5 assists,[3] but the Celtics failed to survive the first round of the 1990 NBA Playoffs.[27] Johnson retired after the Celtics did not offer him a new contract at the beginning of the 1991 season.[28] During his retirement ceremony, his perennial Los Angeles Lakers opponent Magic Johnson telegraphed him and lauded him as ""the best backcourt defender of all-time"".[25] In addition Celtics colleague and triple NBA Most Valuable Player award winner Larry Bird called Johnson the best teammate he ever had.[1] After retiring as a player, Johnson worked as a scout for the Celtics.[1] In 1993, he became an assistant coach for the Celtics, a position he held until 1997.[25] After spending several years outside the limelight, he returned as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers in 2000, and spent four seasons there. For 24 games toward the end of the 2002–03 season, Johnson served as interim head coach after the departure of Alvin Gentry.[25][29] Johnson later worked as a scout for the Portland Trail Blazers, and in 2004 he was named head coach of the NBA Development League's Florida Flame. He became head coach of the NBADL's Austin Toros the following season, and held that position until his death two years later.[25] In 1,100 games, Johnson scored 15,535 points, grabbed 4,249 rebounds and gave 5,499 assists, translating to career averages of 14.1 points, 3.9 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game.[3] Known as a defensive stalwart, he was elected into nine straight All-Defensive First or Second Teams.[3] NBA legend George Gervin said in a podcast with journalist Bill Simmons that Johnson was the hardest defender he ever played against.[30] Johnson is also acknowledged by the NBA as a ""money player""[1] who was clutch in decisive moments, such as scoring 32 points for his team in a Game 4 overtime victory in the 1979 NBA Finals, playing smothering defense on Magic Johnson in the 1984 NBA Finals, and converting a last-second layup in Game 5 of the 1987 Eastern Conference Finals after a Larry Bird steal.[1] Furthermore, Johnson is lauded by the NBA as a versatile all-around weapon who played with ""contagious competitiveness""[1] and was known for his durability: in 14 NBA seasons, he played in 1,100 of a possible 1,148 games and participated in 180 playoff games, the latter figure the 11th highest number of all time.[5] At his retirement, Johnson was only the 11th NBA player to amass more than 15,000 points and 5,000 assists.[1] On December 13, 1991, the Celtics franchise retired his number 3 jersey. Johnson said he would always be a Boston Celtic, and remarked that seeing his number in the rafters gave him a ""special feeling"".[2] However, Johnson did not live to see an induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, a fact that has been a considerable point of debate with sports journalists. Bill Simmons of ESPN called his Hall of Fame snub an ""ongoing injustice"", stating that according to him, Joe Dumars – a Hall of Famer known for strong defense rather than spectacular scoring, like Johnson – was no better [a basketball player] than him.[5] Colleague Ken Shouler called Johnson ""one of the first guys I'd give a Hall [of Fame] pass"".[8] Contemporary Boston Celtics Hall of Fame forward Larry Bird gave Johnson ultimate praise, calling him the best teammate he ever had in his autobiography Drive,[1] which is especially significant considering Bird's teammates included Hall of Famers Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Bill Walton, and Tiny Archibald.[31] On April 3, 2010, ESPN Boston reported that Johnson was posthumously elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.[32] This was officially confirmed two days later when the Hall released the list of 2010 inductees.[4] On October 26, 2007, a learning center was dedicated in Johnson's name in the Central Branch of the YMCA of Greater Boston. The center was made possible by the donations and effort of Larry Bird and M.L. Carr. Johnson's family, Danny Ainge, Carr, and members of the YMCA and local community were present for the ribbon cutting ceremony. Donna Johnson said on behalf of her husband, ""If Dennis were alive he would really appreciate the thought and love the idea of the Learning Center.""[33] The NBA D-League Coach of the Year award is named after Johnson.[citation needed] Dennis Johnson was married to Donna, his wife of 31 years, and had three children named Dwayne, Denise, and Daniel.[34] Johnson was also known for his appearance: he had freckles[35] and red-tinged hair.[36] Dennis's brother, Joey, is a former Arizona State Sun Devils basketball star. Johnson's nephews are Nick, who appeared in 37 games with the 2014–15 Houston Rockets after being drafted by them in the 2nd Round of the 2014 NBA draft, and Chris, who appeared briefly in four games with the 2013–14 Arizona Wildcats college basketball team.[37] On October 20, 1997, Johnson was arrested and detained overnight for allegedly holding a knife to his wife's throat and threatening his 17-year-old son.[38] Johnson was later charged with aggravated assault and was ordered to stay away from his family.[39][40] The prosecutors dropped the case several months later after his wife declined to press charges.[41] Johnson reportedly went to counseling to repair his marriage.[42] On February 22, 2007, at the Austin Convention Center, Johnson had a heart attack and collapsed at the end of the Austin Toros' practice.[25] After being rushed to a nearby hospital, he could not be revived and was later pronounced dead. Johnson was survived by his wife and his children.[25] Johnson's death was met with shock throughout the NBA. Among others, contemporary Celtics colleague Danny Ainge called him one of ""the most underrated players of all time [...] and one of the greatest Celtics acquisitions,""[25] and one-time rival Bill Laimbeer called him ""a great player on a great ballclub.""[25]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/154.png

In 1995, after some criticism that he only invested with other people's money, Johnson took an equity stake along with what was then the Loews chain in the 12-screen multiplex movie theater in Baldwin Hills (now owned by Cinemark). The Beverly Hills–based Magic Johnson Enterprises formerly owned Magic Johnson Theatres in four cities, 31 Burger King restaurants in the Southeast, and 13 24-Hour Fitness/Magic Johnson Sport health clubs. Over the years, Magic Johnson Enterprises has continually invested ownership in many lucrative businesses such as the Los Angeles Lakers, movie theaters and restaurants in the United States, including T.G.I.

In March 2008, Johnson signed a multi-year marketing deal to help electronics retailer Best Buy Co. bolster sales in urban neighborhoods.[1] In October 2010, Johnson sold his interest in 105 Starbucks franchises back to the company.[2] The next day he sold his 4% interest in the Los Angeles Lakers for an estimated $27 million to Patrick Soon-Shiong.[2][3][4] Johnson's urban investments were formed in 2001 as the Canyon-Johnson Urban Fund, an alliance with Canyon Capital. The alliance has financed 31 real estate developments in 13 states and the District Of Columbia. The first Canyon-Johnson Urban Fund struggled for two years to raise $300 million to invest in urban neighborhoods.

In 1961, Johnson returned to Utah State University and played two years on the Utah State Aggies basketball team.[3] Playing under coach LaDell Andersen, Johnson was part of Utah State teams that made the NCAA tournaments of 1962 and 1963. Johnson averaged 12.3 points and 7.1 rebounds in his senior season and graduated from Utah State in 1963 with a B.S. in physical education, and in 1964 he completed his master's degree.[4][5] Johnson began his coaching career in the 1963–64 season as the freshman basketball team coach at Utah State.[6] In 1964, Johnson returned to his junior college alma mater, by then Weber State College, as an assistant coach under Dick Motta. In four seasons with Johnson as an assistant, Weber State finished at the top of the Big Sky Conference in 1965, 1966, and 1968 and made the 1968 NCAA Tournament. In 1968, Johnson became head coach at Weber State. In three seasons with Johnson as head coach, Weber State was Big Sky regular season champions every season and made every NCAA tournament from 1969 to 1971. The Big Sky also recognized Johnson as Coach of the Year in those seasons, as well.[5] Johnson left Weber State with a 68-16 record.[7] In his first NBA coaching job, Johnson again joined Dick Motta's coaching staff in 1971 with the Chicago Bulls.[5] On November 29, 1973, the Kansas City-Omaha Kings hired Johnson as new head coach after firing Bob Cousy.[8] Inheriting a 6–19 team, Johnson went 27–31 for the rest of the season, and the Kings finished 33–49.[9] The following season, Johnson led the Kings a 44–38 record and a berth in the 1975 NBA Playoffs.[10] For this achievement, Johnson earned the 1975 NBA Coach of the Year Award.[5] Johnson was fired on January 7, 1978, following a 13–24 start for the now Kansas City Kings.[11] In 1979, Johnson returned to the Chicago Bulls, this time as an assistant coach on Jerry Sloan's staff.[12][13] When Sloan was fired, Phil completed the year as Rod Thorn's assistant.

Johnston was a 1946 graduate of Chillicothe High School in Chillicothe, Ohio, where he was an all-state selection in basketball.[2] Johnston attended Ohio State University, where he starred in baseball and basketball. Johnston signed a professional baseball contract with the Philadelphia Phillies out of college and pitched two-and-a-half years for the Terre Haute Phillies of the Three-I League. With a 3–9 record halfway through his third losing season in 1951, Johnston decided to give pro basketball a try. With the assistance of his manager, Jim Ward, he tried out for the Philadelphia Warriors at the team camp in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Johnston led the NBA in scoring for three consecutive seasons: 1952–53, 1953–54, and 1954–55. During the 1954–55 season, he also won the league's rebounding title. He led the league in minutes played in the 1952–53 season, 1953–54 season and in field goal percentage in the 1952–53 and 1955–56 season and 1956–57 season. He led the NBA in Win Shares for five consecutive seasons.[3] Johnston played his entire career with the Philadelphia Warriors, playing on their championship team in 1956. He played in six NBA All-Star Games, was an All-NBA First Team selection four times, and was an All-NBA Second Team selection once. During his career, the 6-foot, 8-inch Johnston was well known for his sweeping right-handed hook shot.[4] Johnston was forced to retire after a serious knee injury in the 1958–59 season.

He is best known for his association with the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA), with whom he won eleven of his twelve NBA championships (eight as a player, one as an assistant coach, and two as a head coach).[1] As a player, he is tied for third for most NBA championships in a career, and is one of three NBA players with an 8-0 record in NBA Finals series.[2] He is the only African-American non-player head coach to win multiple NBA championships.[3] Jones was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1989. Jones played college basketball at the University of San Francisco and, along with Bill Russell, led the Dons to two NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956. Jones also played with Russell on the United States team which won the gold medal at the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne, Australia. After completing college and joining the NBA, Jones considered a career as a NFL player, even trying out for a team. However, he failed to make the cut. During his playing days, he was known as a tenacious defender. Jones spent all of his nine seasons in the NBA with the Boston Celtics, being part of eight championship teams from 1959 to 1966. Jones and Russell, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Jerry Lucas, Clyde Lovellette and Quinn Buckner are the only players in history to win an NCAA Championship, an NBA Championship, and an Olympic Gold Medal.[4] In NBA history, only teammates Bill Russell (11 championships) and Sam Jones (10 championships) have won more championship rings during their playing careers. After Boston lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1967 playoffs, Jones ended his playing career. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1989.[5] Jones began his coaching career at Brandeis University, serving as the head coach from 1967 to 1970. Jones served as an assistant coach at Harvard University from 1970 to 1971.[6] Jones then reunited with former teammate Bill Sharman as the assistant coach for the 1971–72 NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers during the season the team won a record 33 straight games. The following season, Jones became the first coach of the San Diego Conquistadors, an American Basketball Association franchise which would have a very short life. A year later, in 1973 he became head coach of the Capital Bullets (which became the Washington Bullets one year later), coaching them for three seasons and leading them to the NBA Finals in 1975. In 1983, he took over as head coach of the Boston Celtics, replacing Bill Fitch. Jones guided the Larry Bird-led Celtics to championships in 1984 and 1986.[7] Also in 1986, Jones led the Eastern squad in the 1986 NBA All-Star Game in Dallas at the Reunion Arena, beating the Western squad 139–132. The Celtics won the Atlantic Division in all five of Jones's seasons as head coach and reached the NBA Finals in 4 of his 5 years as coach. In a surprise announcement, he retired after the 1987-88 season and was succeeded by assistant coach, Jimmy Rodgers.[8] He spent one season in the Celtics front office in 1988-89 and then resigned to join the Seattle SuperSonics as an assistant coach and basketball consultant for the 1989-90 season.[9] He served as head coach of the Sonics in 1990-91 and 1991-92. In 1994, Jones joined the Detroit Pistons as an assistant coach for one season. The Pistons head coach at that time, Don Chaney, had previously played for Jones with the Celtics.[10] Jones was also considered to once again coach the Celtics during the off-season in 1995.[11] In 1996, Jones returned to the Boston Celtics, this time as an assistant coach for one season.[12] Jones returned to the professional coaching ranks in 1997, guiding the New England Blizzard of the fledgling women's American Basketball League (1996–1998) through its last 1½ seasons of existence. The Blizzard made the playoffs in Year 2, but they were summarily dispatched by the San Jose Lasers.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/159.png

He formerly served as head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers, Washington Wizards, and Sacramento Kings in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was also head coach for three seasons at Rutgers University, where he played basketball but left without receiving a degree. Jordan attended Rutgers University from 1973–1977. He was enrolled as a physical education student, but failed to graduate.[1][2][3] Jordan helped lead the school to the 1976 NCAA Final Four, during which he was named East Regional MVP. At Rutgers, Jordan acquired the nickname ""Fast Eddie.""[4] In his senior season, Jordan was named honorable mention All-America, while setting Rutgers' all-time career records in assists (585) and steals (220). Jordan was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round of the 1977 NBA draft (33rd overall), and was acquired by the New Jersey Nets halfway through his rookie season. Jordan tied Norm Nixon (Los Angeles Lakers) for the lead in total steals with 201 in 1978–1979,[5] and was second in total steals, 223, in 1979–80 (behind the New York Knicks' Micheal Ray Richardson with 265).[6] Jordan played for the Los Angeles Lakers during the 1980–81 season, and was a member of the 1982 NBA World Championship team. He played for the Lakers for four years and then played briefly with the Portland Trail Blazers. Jordan retired from the NBA after the 1983–84 season. Over his seven-year NBA career, Jordan averaged 8.1 points, 3.8 assists and 1.82 steals per game. After retiring from the NBA in 1984, Jordan was a volunteer assistant at Rutgers University under his former college head coach, and his eventual Wizards' assistant, Tom Young. Jordan followed Young to Old Dominion University as a part-time assistant as before and subsequently obtained an assistant coaching position at Boston College under Jim O'Brien in 1986. He also became an assistant coach at Rutgers in 1988. In 1992, Jordan became an assistant coach with the Sacramento Kings, and remained an assistant for five seasons. Jordan was promoted to head coach on March 20, 1997 during the final fifteen games of the 1996–97 regular season and remained the head coach during the 1997–98 season, during which he compiled a 33–64 record as the Kings' head coach. Jordan was fired after the 1997–98 season. Jordan joined the New Jersey Nets coaching staff on March 17, 1999 and served as the lead assistant for four seasons. While in New Jersey, Jordan helped guide the squad to consecutive Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference Championships in 2002 and 2003. Later that year, Jordan signed a four-year contract worth a little more than $3 million per year with the Washington Wizards and was introduced as head coach of the team on June 19, 2003. Washington finished with a 25–57 record during Jordan's inaugural season as head coach. The following year, Jordan helped guide the Wizards to a 20-game improvement in 2004–05. Only the Chicago Bulls and Phoenix Suns experienced a greater improvement in total wins from the previous year. On April 11, 2005 Jordan won his 100th career game as a head coach, and improved his career record to 103-158. During the 2004–05 regular season, Jordan's second with the Wizards, he led the team to a 45–37 record, which was the franchise's best season since 1978–79. The record established a new record for wins in a season at Verizon Center, earned the team a five seed in the Eastern Conference, and was the Wizards' first playoff berth since the 1996–97 season. The Wizards played the fourth seeded Chicago Bulls and won the series four games to two. The team rallied from a 0–2 deficit to win the series with four consecutive wins. It was the team's first postseason series win since 1982. In the 2006–07 season, Jordan guided the Wizards to a third straight playoff berth for the first time since 1988. Jordan won the Coach of the Month award for December, guiding Washington to a 12–4 record during that month. Jordan coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars at the NBA All-Star Game on February 18 in Las Vegas, the first coach from the franchise since Dick Motta in 1978–79. In the 2007–08 season Jordan led the Wizards to a fourth straight playoff berth despite beginning the year 0–5. The Wizards were eliminated in the first round by the Cleveland Cavaliers for the third straight year. Jordan was fired as head coach of the Washington Wizards on November 24, 2008 after a 1–10 start. At the time of his firing Jordan was the longest tenured coach in the Eastern Conference and as their coach he guided the Wizards to four straight playoff appearances, advancing only once. He compiled a regular season record of 197–224. The 197 victories rank third all-time in franchise history.[7] Jordan was officially introduced as the head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers on June 1, 2009.[8] On Thursday, April 15, Jordan was fired by the 76ers after one season.[9] Later that month, it was reported that Jordan had been one of the leading candidates for the head coaching vacancy at his alma mater, Rutgers, but had pulled out of the running to continue to seek a new coaching job in the NBA.[10] In 2012, Jordan was hired as an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Lakers.[11] Jordan was brought in primarily to assist head coach Mike Brown in installing the Princeton offense. On April 18, 2013, it was reported that Rutgers would name Jordan head coach, replacing fired head coach Mike Rice.[12][13] On April 23, 2013, Rutgers officially announced the hiring of Eddie Jordan as the 18th head coach of the men's basketball program.[14][15][16] In three years as coach of the Scarlet Knights, which included their transition from the American Athletic Conference to the Big Ten Conference, Jordan finished each season with twenty or more losses and the 2015–16 season was the worst of the three. Rutgers finished with twenty-five losses, sixteen of which were in conference; a victory against Minnesota in their final regular season game prevented the Scarlet Knights from finishing winless in Big Ten play and broke a thirty-two game conference losing streak. Jordan's final game was on March 9, 2016 as the Scarlet Knights lost to Nebraska in the opening round of the Big Ten tournament; Rutgers announced his firing the next day. His overall record was 29–68, with an 8–46 record on conference play.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/161.png

He led the Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball program to consecutive national titles, winning the NCAA Basketball Tournament in 1961 and 1962. Jucker was also the head coach of the Cincinnati Bearcats baseball team from 1954 to 1960 while serving as an assistant coach for the basketball team. He spent two seasons coaching in the professional ranks, leading the Cincinnati Royals of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1967 to 1969. Jucker served as the athletic director at Rollins College from 1981 to 1983. Jucker was born in Norwood, Ohio. He attended the University of Cincinnati as an undergraduate student and played on the school's basketball teams during the 1938, 1939, and 1940 seasons.[1] He was the captain of the 1940 team. Also, while an undergraduate, Jucker became a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Jucker was a professional baseball prospect until he decided to start coaching instead of trying to make it into Major League Baseball. His coaching career began at Batavia High in Clermont County, Ohio, east of Cincinnati. Following service in the Navy during World War II, he joined the college coaching ranks as assistant basketball coach at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in 1946. Two years later, he became head basketball coach at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Jucker returned to the University of Cincinnati in 1953 as assistant basketball coach and baseball mentor. He directed the UC freshmen to a 67–21 record in six years, while his baseball teams were 87–38 over seven seasons. In 1954, Jucker recruited Sandy Koufax at Cincinnati. After watching Koufax in his first practice, Jucker got him a work-study scholarship. Under Jucker's coaching direction in the early 60s, Cincinnati won back-to-back NCAA Basketball Tournament, in 1961 and 1962, defeating Ohio State, who had the great Jerry Lucas and Bob Knight, both years. His 1963 team reached the championship game of the NCAA tournament, where the Bearcats were upended 60–58 in overtime by Loyola of Chicago and All-American Jerry Harkness. Jucker holds the record for the highest winning percentage (.917) in NCAA tournament play. In his five seasons coaching the Bearcats, Jucker's team posted a record of 113–28, a .801 winning percentage.[2] Jucker left UC after the 1965 season. He agreed to coach Spanish national team from 1967 but changed his mind when he received offers from the National Basketball Association (NBA).[3] In 1967, he became the head coach of the Cincinnati Royals of the National Basketball Association, a position he held for two seasons. Jucker then went to Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida where he built the school's basketball program into a national contender in NCAA Division II. In 1978, he was inducted into the University of Cincinnati Athletics Hall of Fame.[4] Also, the court that the University of Cincinnati plays on is named after Jucker. The number he wore as Cincinnati baseball coach is one of only two numbers retired by the school's baseball team.[5] Jucker died of prostate cancer on Callawassie Island, South Carolina in 2002 at age 85.

164,George Karl,"May 12, 1951",,,UNC,1985,2016,27,true,,"""[6, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2]""",/coaches/karlge01c.html,"George Matthew Karl (born May 12, 1951) is an American former professional basketball coach and former player. He is one of 9 coaches in NBA history to have won 1,000 NBA games, though he never won a championship. Born and raised in Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, a suburb northeast of Pittsburgh, Karl starred at Penn Hills High School and graduated in 1969.[1] He played collegiately at the University of North Carolina for three years on the varsity under head coach Dean Smith. In his senior season in 1973, the Tar Heels finished third in the NIT, with an overall record of 25–8. (The NCAA Tournament included just 25 teams in 1973.) Selected in the fourth round of 1973 NBA draft by the New York Knicks, Karl opted instead to sign with the ABA's San Antonio Spurs. He spent three years as the team's starting point guard, playing with George Gervin. After the Spurs joined the NBA in 1976, Karl played limited minutes over the next two years, and retired as a player in 1978. After his playing career, Karl spent two years with the Spurs coaching staff as an assistant coach. He was then named head coach of the Montana Golden Nuggets of the Continental Basketball Association. Karl guided the team to the CBA Finals in 1981 and 1983, winning Coach of the Year both seasons.[2] Despite the success on the court, the franchise folded in 1983. In 1983, Karl returned to the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers as director of player acquisition. Head coach Tom Nissalke was fired after the season in May 1984, and at age age 33, Karl was promoted to head coach in late July.[3] In his first season, the Cavaliers made the playoffs for the first time in six seasons. The success did not carry over to the next season, and Karl was dismissed by the Cavaliers in mid-March after a disappointing 25–42 start;[4][5] Cleveland finished 4–11 under assistant Gene Littles to end up at 29–53 (.354). For the next two months, he was a scout and adviser to the Milwaukee Bucks.[6] In late May 1986, Karl was named head coach of the Golden State Warriors;[7] he took them from a record of 30–52 the year before, to the playoffs for the first time in ten years.[8] In the first round, they faced the Utah Jazz in a best–of–five series. Each team won two close games at home setting up a decisive fifth game in Utah that the Warriors won to advance to the playoff semifinals. Matched up in the semifinals against the Los Angeles Lakers, who had won three championships in the past seven seasons, Karl's team was expected to be swept by the much more experienced Lakers, and promptly lost the first three games. Facing elimination in game 4, the Warriors overcame a twelve–point fourth quarter deficit and won 129–121.[9] Game 4 was the only game the Lakers lost in the Western Conference playoffs that year, en route to the first of their back–to–back championships. During the 1987–88 season, the Warriors got off to a rough start, and team management decided to trade Purvis Short, Sleepy Floyd and Joe Barry Carroll in order to save money and get younger. With Chris Mullin going through alcohol rehabilitation, Karl was now without his top four scorers from the 1987 playoff team.[10] Frustrated with the team's direction, he resigned from the Warriors with 18 games left in the season.[11] Though he resigned, there has been speculation Karl was actually fired,[12] as he signed a non-disclosure agreement and received a buyout of his contract.[13] On September 5, 1988, Karl was named head coach of the Albany Patroons of the CBA,[14] leading them to a 36–18 record. In 1989, Karl coached Real Madrid of Liga ACB. Madrid finished 69–17, though they dealt with the death of their best player, Fernando Martín Espina.[15] Real Madrid came third in the Spanish league, were Spanish cup semifinalists, and lost the final of the Saporta Cup, Europe's second most important cup competition. Karl returned to coach the Patroons in 1990, leading them to a 50–6 season, while winning all 28 home games. For his efforts, Karl was named CBA Coach of the Year for the third time.[16] Karl then returned to Real Madrid for the 1991–92 season, until he left to return to the NBA.[17] Real Madrid won the Saporta Cup, came second in the Spanish league, and lost in the quarterfinals of the Spanish cup. On January 23, 1992, Karl was named head coach of the Seattle SuperSonics, replacing K. C. Jones.[18] Karl led a late season surge going 27–15, and entering the playoffs as the sixth seed.[19] In the first round, they upset his former team, the Golden State Warriors in four games, but lost in the second round to the Utah Jazz. In his second (and first full) season as the SuperSonics coach in 1992–93, the team improved their 47–35 record to 55–27, and qualified for the playoffs as the third seed in the Western Conference. They defeated the Utah Jazz 3–2 in the first round and the Houston Rockets 4–3 in the semifinals. Seattle lost in the Western Conference Finals to the Charles Barkley–led Phoenix Suns in a full seven game series, falling just one game short of the NBA Finals. The following season, Seattle won 63 games and its first Pacific Division title since their 1979 championship season. Despite a rift with mid-season acquisition Kendall Gill,[20] Karl led the Sonics to the top seed in the Western Conference. Playing the eighth–seeded Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the playoffs, Seattle won their first two games at home, but lost the following three, including the closing game at home, to become the first top seed to lose to an eighth-seed in the playoffs history. The 1994–95 season had a similar result when Seattle suffered another first–round [[1995 NBA playoffs|playoff]] loss after finishing the season 57–25. This time, Karl's fourth-seed SuperSonics were defeated by the fifth–seeded Los Angeles Lakers led by point guard Nick Van Exel, who clashed with Karl during the 1993 NBA rookie workouts.[21] Fans and media called for Karl's dismissal after his back-to-back first round losses,[22] but the team instead traded the disgruntled Kendall Gill to Charlotte for Hersey Hawkins, showing a sign of confidence in Karl.[23] Karl responded to the disappointing playoff exits with the best regular season in SuperSonics history, posting a 14–game winning streak between February and March to finish the 1995–96 season with a franchise-best 64–18 record. Led by All-Stars Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton, the latter named Defensive Player of the Year, the SuperSonics defeated the Sacramento Kings three games to one in the first round, and then swept the two-time reigning champions Houston Rockets to advance to the Western Conference Finals. They defeated the Utah Jazz in seven games to advance to their first NBA Finals since 1979. In the NBA Finals, the SuperSonics met the 72–10 Chicago Bulls. Seattle was out-matched by Michael Jordan's scoring, Dennis Rodman's rebounding and the Bulls' team defense, and quickly found themselves in a 0–3 deficit and facing a sweep. Karl and the SuperSonics responded with a 21–point game 4 blowout win and a narrow win in game 5, to narrow the series deficit to 3–2. The Bulls won the series and game 6 in Chicago. The 64 wins and Finals appearance marked what was undoubtedly the zenith of Karl's coaching career. Seattle amassed a 118–46 (.720) record during the next two seasons, winning the Pacific Division title both years. Seattle overcame a 3–1 deficit to force a game 7 against Houston in the second round of the 1997 NBA playoffs, but was defeated. The following year, Seattle fell swiftly to the Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals. The back-to-back second round playoff exits and his deteriorating relationship with general manager Wally Walker [24] led to Karl's eventual dismissal before the 1998-99 season. The SuperSonics went 384–150 (.719) and averaged 59 wins per season under Karl, second only to Chicago during that span.[25] He took Seattle to the playoffs in all seven seasons of his tenure. The SuperSonics won four division championships and twice finished with the best record in the Western Conference. Despite regular season success, Karl's SuperSonics managed only a 40-40 postseason record, and advanced to the NBA Finals just once. On August 30, 1998, Karl was named head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, lured by a particularly lucrative contract offer.[26] Coming to a team that had not made the playoffs in seven seasons, Karl helped rebuild the struggling organization by making the playoffs in each of his first three seasons, steadily increasing their win totals. In his first two seasons they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Indiana Pacers; after losing in a three-game sweep his first season, the Bucks lost three games to two in his second season. In his third season, Karl guided the Bucks, led by a ""Big Three"" of Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen and Sam Cassell to their first division championship in 15 years, which culminated with an appearance in the 2001 Eastern Conference Finals (they lost in seven games). The Bucks entered his fourth season with high expectations, however they finished ninth place in the conference and missed the playoffs. Seeded as high as fourth in the conference halfway through the season, the Bucks collapsed and were eliminated from the playoffs in the final regular season game. Dealing with injuries, Karl was also reportedly at odds with Robinson and Allen.[27] Following the season, Robinson was traded to Atlanta.[28] At the 2002-03 trade deadline, Allen was traded to Seattle for Gary Payton.[29] Though Payton and Karl had success together in Seattle and the move allowed more minutes for Michael Redd, it made Cassell the odd man out[30] and broke up a core that was within one game of the NBA Finals just two years prior.[31] The Bucks finished the 2002-03 season 42-40 to qualify for the playoffs, though they were eliminated in the first round in six games. Karl pushed for the team to draft point guard TJ Ford, making Cassell expendable and he was traded to Minnesota.[32] GM Ernie Grunfeld, who was arguably Karl's biggest supporter in Milwaukee, left the team shortly after the draft, and new GM Larry Harris decided to move the team in a new direction and fired Karl.[33] In the aftermath of Karl's departure, the Bucks would not win a playoff series until 2019.[34] He coached the US national team in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.[35] On January 27, 2005, the Denver Nuggets named Karl their head coach, taking over from interim head coach Michael Cooper (who stayed on as an assistant coach).[36] Karl made an immediate impact on the Nuggets, taking a team floundering at 17–25 to a 32–8 record in the second half of the 2004–05 season to finish 49–33. They lost in the playoffs to the San Antonio Spurs, who went on to win the NBA Championship that season. On July 27, 2005, the Nuggets announced that Karl had prostate cancer, but was cleared to continue coaching after he had surgery.[37] He led the Nuggets to the Northwest division title that season, Denver's first in 18 years.[38] Karl was criticized for his role in the Knicks–Nuggets brawl on December 16, 2006, allegedly trying to run up the score and humiliate Isiah Thomas by keeping his starting players in the final minutes of a blowout win.[39][40][41] On December 28, 2006, Karl became just the 12th coach in NBA history to reach 800 wins when the Nuggets defeated the SuperSonics 112–98. Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson were named All–Stars that season, Denver's first All-Star selections since 2001. During the 2008–09 season, the Nuggets, led by Karl, Carmelo Anthony, and the newly acquired Chauncey Billups tied a franchise–best 54 wins and entered the playoffs as the Western Conference's #2 seed. On April 27, 2009, the Nuggets handed the Hornets a 58–point loss during Game 4 of their first round playoff series. This tied the biggest margin in NBA playoff history[42] The Nuggets beat the Mavericks in 5 games during the semifinals, then went on to lose to the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in 6 games, losing Game 6 by 27.[43] Karl coached the Western Conference All–Stars at the 2010 NBA All-Star Game on February 14 at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas.[44] This was his fourth selection, and his first since leaving Seattle. After the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, it was revealed in a press conference that Karl was diagnosed with treatable neck and throat cancer.[45] He was placed on leave of absence from the Nuggets for the remainder of the season while receiving treatment. Assistant coach Adrian Dantley filled in as acting head coach, and the team finished poorly, going from the second to fourth seed, and lost their first round playoff series.[46] Karl went through chemotherapy treatments,[47] and coached every game of the 2010–11 season, becoming the seventh NBA coach to record 1,000 career wins on December 10, 2010.[48][49] During the season, Carmelo Anthony requested and was granted a trade to New York, and Karl was now coaching a considerably younger and less experienced team.[50] Without Anthony, Denver's leading scorer for seven years, Karl put an emphasis on team-oriented play. In their first full season without Anthony, the Nuggets finished the regular season leading the league in points per game (104.12) and assists per game (23.96),[51] though they were also near the bottom of the league in defensive rating. They pushed their first–round playoff series against the Lakers to seven games, but were defeated The newly acquired Andre Iguodala immediately helped the team's defense, and the Nuggets finished with their best record since joining the NBA in 1977, at 57–25. Noted for his efforts in bringing the team together without Carmelo Anthony, their offensive success with a traditional go–to–scorer, and his leadership for the league's third-youngest team (with an average age of 24.9 years), Karl was awarded his first NBA Coach of the Year Award for the 2012–13 season.[52][53] The Nuggets and Karl's historic season came to a disappointing end with a first–round playoff loss to the Golden State Warriors in six games. The Nuggets were without their second–leading scorer Danilo Gallinari, who was out with an ACL injury.[54] The series was noted for its controversy, with Warriors coach Mark Jackson admitting he had ""inside information"" on Denver's playing style.[55] Karl alleged Iguodala was the ""mole"" for the Warriors, which fueled speculation when he agreed to a four–year contract with Golden State following the playoff loss.[56][57] Following Denver GM Masai Ujiri's departure, Karl pushed the Nuggets for a contract extension, as he was entering the final season of his contract.[58] On June 6, 2013, Karl was fired by Denver, just 29 days after he was named Coach of the Year.[53][59] George Karl left the Nuggets with a 423-257 record, just nine wins shy of Doug Moe's franchise–record 432 wins. Similar to his stint in Seattle, Karl's teams constantly overachieved, which in the end is used against him with his playoff record.[53][60] On February 12, 2015, after several weeks of talks and speculation, Karl agreed to a deal to become the head coach of the Sacramento Kings, after signing a four-year, $15 million contract.[61][62] He was officially introduced by the Kings on February 17.[63] In his first season as coach the Kings went 11–19 in 30 games. On April 14, 2016, Karl was fired by the Kings after a disappointing 2015–16 season in which the Kings went 33–49.[64][65] Karl was also only one game shy from coaching his 2,000th game in the NBA. Karl's son, Coby, played as a starting point guard for Boise State, and has since played in the NBA and other leagues. Coby Karl is a thyroid cancer survivor.[66] Karl also has two daughters, Kelci and Kaci.[67] Karl is an avid supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and serves as an ambassador for their Hoops for St. Jude basketball initiative.[68]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/164.png
165,Bob Kauffman,"July 13, 1946","July 25, 2015","Scarsdale in Scarsdale, New York",Guilford College,1978,1978,1,true,,"""[9]""",/coaches/kauffbo01c.html,"Robert Kauffman (July 13, 1946 – July 25, 2015) was an American professional basketball player and coach. Kaufmann was a three time NBA All-Star.[1] Robert Alan Kauffman was born July 13, 1946 in Brooklyn, N.Y., to LeRoy and Anne Kauffman. He played at Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale, New York.[2] The Kauffman family was in the saddle and bridle business. Kauffman’s Boots and Saddles was their business on East 24th Street in Manhattan.[3] Kauffman, from Scarsdale, New York, played collegiately at NAIA Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina, from 1964–1968, playing under Coach Jerry Steele. The 6-foot-8, 240-pound center is credited with turning the Quakers into an NAIA basketball powerhouse that won 86 games with three straight trips to the NAIA Tournament in his four seasons. Kauffman scored 2,570 points on 64% shooting with 1,801 rebounds in his 113-game career. He averaged 22.7 points and 15.9 rebounds in his career. He has Guilford records for single-game rebounds (32), single-season rebounds (698, 1967–68), career field goals (943), single-season field goal percentage (.712, 1967–68), single-season free throws (273, 1966–67), career free throws (684) and single-season free-throw attempts (344, 1966–67).[4] Kauffman graduated with a history degree in 1968.[5][6] Kauffman was selected with the third overall pick of the 1968 NBA Draft by the Seattle SuperSonics behind future Hall of Fame inductees Elvin Hayes and Wes Unseld. Kauffman was also selected in the 1968 American Basketball Association Draft by the Oakland Oaks, but chose to play in the NBA. As a rookie for Seattle in 1968-1969, Kauffman averaged 7.8 points and 5.9 rebounds, playing behind Bob Rule.[7] On September 5, 1969 Kauffman was traded by the Seattle SuperSonics with a 1971 3rd round draft pick (Clifford Ray was later selected) to the Chicago Bulls for Bob Boozer and Barry Clemens. Kauffman played a reserve role for the Bulls in 1969-1970, averaging 4.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in 12 minutes per game.[8] On May 11, 1970, Kauffman was traded, completing a trade on September 2, 1969, he was traded by the Chicago Bulls with Jim Washington to the Philadelphia 76ers for Shaler Halimon and Chet Walker. Kauffman was sent as the player to be named later on May 11, 1970.[8] Later, the expansion Buffalo Braves acquired him and a 1971 2nd round draft pick (Spencer Haywood was later selected) from the Philadelphia 76ers the day of the NBA Expansion Draft, May 11, 1970, in exchange for veteran forward Bailey Howell. Kauffman never played for Philadelphia.[3][9] In 1970-1971, playing for the Buffalo Braves, Kauffman became an All-Star, averaging 20.4 points and 10.7 rebounds for the 22-60 Braves under Coach Dolph Schayes. He was a reserve for the first six games of the season, scoring 26 points total in the first six games, before being inserted into the starting lineup.[10][11] The Braves struggled again in 1971-1972, again finishing 22-60, but Kauffman was an All-Star for the second time, averaging 18.9 points and 10.2 rebounds. Kauffman had 44 points against Kareem Abdul Jabbar and the Milwaukee Bucks on November 13, 1971.[12] Under new Coach Jack Ramsay, Kauffman was an All-Star again in 1972-1973, averaging 17.5 points and 11.1 rebounds for the 21-61 Braves.[13][14] In 1973-1974, the Braves improved to 42-40, making the playoffs. Kauffman became a reserve, averaging 6.1 points and 4.4 rebounds in 17 minutes, on a roster that included Hall of Famer Bob McAdoo, Randy Smith and Gar Heard.[15] On May 20, 1974 Kauffman was drafted by the New Orleans Jazz from the Buffalo Braves in the NBA expansion draft. He was immediately traded by the Jazz in a landmark trade. He was traded with Dean Meminger, a 1974 1st round draft pick (Mike Sojourner was later selected), a 1975 1st round draft pick (David Thompson was later selected), a 1975 2nd round draft pick (Bill Willoughby was later selected), a 1976 2nd round draft pick (Alex English was later selected) and a 1980 3rd round draft pick (Jonathan Moore was later selected) to the Atlanta Hawks for Pete Maravich.[8] With chronic groin and hip problems limiting his play, Kauffman played the final season of his career with the 1974-1975 Hawks. He averaged 3.9 points and 2.5 points in 73 games for the 31-51 Hawks, under Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons.[16][3] Kauffman played seven seasons in the NBA as a member of the Sonics, Chicago Bulls, Buffalo Braves, and Atlanta Hawks. A three-time All-Star (in 1971, 1972, and 1973), Kauffman averaged 11.5 points and 7.0 rebounds for his career. He had his statistically strongest season in 1970–71, when he averaged 20.4 points and 10.7 rebounds for the Braves.[17] He had a short career as an NBA team executive with the Atlanta Hawks and Detroit Pistons. He spent two seasons as assistant general manager for the Hawks before Detroit hired him as the Pistons' general manager in 1977.[4] He was with the Pistons from May 25, 1977 to July 14, 1978.[18] He served as coach of the Detroit Pistons in 1977-1978 after Herb Brown was fired, going 29-29 in 58 games.[19] Kauffman eventually left the Pistons after a disagreement with team owner Bill Davidson. Kauffman wanted to hire Cotton Fitzsimmons or Al Bianchi, for the coaching vacancy. Davidson wanted Dick Vitale from the University of Detroit. Vitale went 34-60 in his tenure as Pistons coach.[18][3][20] Bob Kauffman died at the age of 69 peacefully one night as his heart stopped. Bob was a basketball player who played collegiately and professionally in the early 1960s to early 1970s. Although his career was not long he was able to accomplish many things throughout his time playing. Kauffman came from a relatively small college in which they competed other small colleges in the NAIA, a subdivision of the NCAA, Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina. He was one of the prominent and promising players in all of college basketball at his time. When he was drafted he played for several different teams and was successful for all of them. Bob was able to make the NBA all star team in 3 of his 7 seasons, from 1971–1973. While at Guilford he was an all-American and one of the best to ever play in the NAIA, coming as a top 3 pick in the 1968 NBA draft. Many believe Bob Kauffman should have played longer but due to injury had to call it quits sooner than expected. Most people remember him as the pioneer of tough basketball. He is the original blue collar worker, always worked hard for shots, rebounds and especially defensively where he competed against some of the best to ever play the game. He was physical and a lot of people enjoyed watching that type of play Some of Bob's more outstanding accolades from college include, 32 rebounds in a single game, 698 rebounds in a single season, while averaging 15.9 for his college career. He has made 943 career field goals, shot a very impressive 71.2 percent in single-season from the field, 273 free-throws attempted in a single-season, while shooting a total of 344 in a single-season, nearly one third of his career free-throws made which happens to be 684 and single-season free-throw attempts (344, 1966–67). These were all of his great stats released by his alma mater Guilford. Many believe the jersey worn by Kauffman when he played for the Buffalo Braves should be retired by the clippers since he was the original star of the program. As reported by NBA.com Bob Kauffman's death went extremely unnoticed in the sports world. He was the first real star for the Buffalo Braves, now the Los Angeles Clippers, making three consecutive appearances in the all-star game. Kauffman is survived by his wife, Judy and four daughters; Lara, Joannah, Carey, and Kate. All of his daughters have had prolific basketball careers at the collegiate level for Georgia Tech, Duke, and Clayton University.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/165.png
166,Red Kerr,"July 17, 1932","February 26, 2009","Tilden in Chicago, Illinois",Illinois,1967,1970,4,true,,"""[5, 2]""",/coaches/kerrre01c.html,"John Graham ""Red"" Kerr (July 17, 1932[1] – February 26, 2009) was an American basketball player, coach, and color commentator. He played in the NBA from 1954 to 1966, mainly as a member of the Syracuse Nationals. He later held several coaching and administrative positions before embarking on a thirty-three year career as a television color commentator for the Chicago Bulls. Although Johnny Kerr's first passion was soccer, an eight-inch growth spurt during his senior year at Tilden Technical High School, and some friendly persuasion from basketball Head Coach Bill Postl, Kerr turned his attention to basketball. The 6' 9"" center soon led his school's basketball team to the 1950 Chicago Public League Championship.[2][3] Kerr graduated mid-year from Tilden (January 1950) and was all set to attend Bradley in the fall, however, after a visit from Illini freshman Irv Bemoras, touting the benefits of playing for Harry Combes and the Fighting Illini, Kerr made a visit to Champaign and quickly changed his mind.[4] After committing to Illinois in the fall of 1950, Kerr played on the freshman team for the 1950-51 season. As he played on the freshman team, the 1950-51 Fighting Illini varsity team would not only win the Big Ten Championship, they would also play in the NCAA Tournament, placing third. Unfortunately for Kerr, the following season would see the two leading scorers, team MVP and captain Don Sunderlage (471 points) and Ted Beach (295 points), graduate. Even with the loss of 766 points, the Illini picked up where they had left off making Kerr's sophomore season a huge success. He was named the starting center for the 1951-52 Fighting Illini and would lead the team to a Big Ten Conference Championship with a 12-2 conference record and a 22-4 record overall and advanced to the NCAA Tournament. Illinois would defeat Dayton and Duquesne to earn a berth in the Final Four (only sixteen teams played in the tournament back then), but would lose to St. Johns, 61–59. They would defeat Santa Clara in the third place game. This was Illinois’ third Big Ten Championship and 20-game winning team within a four year span and completed the season with a final AP ranking of No. 2 in the nation. Kerr would score a team high 357 points in 26 games for an average of 13.7 points per game. Kerr joined three other starters from the previous season on the 1952-53 Illini team, however, the team would not enjoy the same amount of success. The team would lose four conference games during the Big Ten season and finish at 18-4 overall with a conference record of 14-4, which would give them a second-place finish to National Champion Indiana. Kerr, on the other hand, would find his successes to be just as fruitful as the previous campaign. Kerr would score a team high 386 points in 22 games for an average of 17.5 points per game while the team would finish the season with a final AP ranking of No. 11 in the nation. Kerr's senior season was personally the best of his three varsity seasons, however, the team would be the least successful during the same time-frame. The 1953-54 Illini would finish third in the Big Ten with a 10-4 record and an overall record of 17-5 and they would also finish the season with a final AP ranking of No. 19 in the nation. As for Kerr, for the third year in a row he would lead the team in scoring by shattering Illinois’ single-season scoring record by tallying 556 points in just 22 games for a 25.3 points per game average. Over his three varsity seasons, Kerr scored 1,299 points giving him an overall average of 18.6 points per game. He was elected to the University of Illinois' ""All-Century Team"" in 2004.[5] In 1954, the Syracuse Nationals selected Johnny Kerr with the sixth overall pick of the NBA draft. During his first season (1954–55), Kerr averaged 10.5 points and 6.6 rebounds and helped the Nationals capture their first NBA Championship. He became a three time All-Star (1956, 1959, 1963) with the Nationals, despite playing in the shadow of future Hall-of–Famer Dolph Schayes. In 1963, the Nationals relocated to Philadelphia and became known as the 76ers. Two years later, Kerr was traded to the Baltimore Bullets for Wali Jones. After averaging 11.0 points and 8.3 rebounds for the Bullets during the 1965–66 season, Kerr was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the 1966 NBA Expansion Draft. However, Kerr voluntarily retired so that he could become the coach of his hometown's new basketball team. He ended his career on November 4, 1965 with a 108–107 loss to New York, with respectable totals of 12,480 points and 10,092 rebounds, along with the NBA record for most consecutive games played (844) until 1983 when he was surpassed by Randy Smith.[6] Kerr is credited with bringing Jerry Sloan to the Chicago Bulls.[7] The team went 33-48 in 1966–1967 and became the first expansion team to win a playoff berth in its inaugural season. For this accomplishment, Kerr was awarded the NBA Coach of the Year Award. He is also the only coach to receive this award after his team finished with a losing record. The Bulls went 29-53 the following season, rallying from a 1-15 start to earn another playoff berth. However, feuds with team owner Dick Klein forced Kerr to leave the Bulls during the summer of 1968 and sign with the Phoenix Suns, another expansion team in need of its first coach. Unfortunately, the Suns finished with a 16-66 record in 1968–69, and after starting the 1969–70 season with a 15-23 record, Kerr was forced to resign. Despite resigning as coach, Kerr stayed with the Suns franchise for the remainder of the 1969–70 season, working as a broadcaster with Hot Rod Hundley. He spent the next two seasons as a business manager with the ABA's Virginia Squires,[8] then returned to the Chicago Bulls to work in their front office. In 1975, the Bulls' play-by-play announcer, Jim Durham, suggested that Kerr provide commentary during games,[9] and Kerr remained as a color commentator until the end of the 2007–08 season.[10] As a broadcaster, Kerr oversaw the Bulls' six championships in the 1990s and Michael Jordan's entire career with the team. He was known for making the call on ""The Shot"", Jordan's series-winning basket in Game 5 of the first round of the 1989 Eastern Conference Playoffs. Over the years, Kerr and Jordan developed a pre-game ritual in which Jordan would head to the broadcasting area and playfully clap talcum powder in front of Kerr.[11] Jordan later said, ""I don't know how it started. I think he had a nice suit on and I wanted to mess him up a little.""[12] Kerr made occasional appearances as a halftime commentator during the first half of the 2008–09 season, but struggles with prostate cancer gradually limited his involvement.[13] The Bulls honored Kerr for his years of service at a February 10, 2009 halftime ceremony, where the team unveiled a sculpture of Kerr that would stand in the United Center. At the ceremony, Kerr also received the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame's John W. Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award, presented by Jerry Colangelo. February 10, 2009 was declared Johnny Red Kerr Appreciation Day in the city of Chicago by Mayor Richard M. Daley.[14] Kerr died of prostate cancer on February 26, 2009 only hours after the death of fellow Bulls legend Norm Van Lier.[15][16] [22]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/166.png

Kerr has the highest career three-point percentage (45.4%) in NBA history for any player with at least 250 three-pointers made. He also held the NBA record for highest three-point percentage in a season at 52.4% until the record was broken by Kyle Korver in 2010. On June 2, 2007, the Phoenix Suns named Kerr the team's president of basketball operations and general manager. Kerr helped managing partner Robert Sarver buy the Suns in 2004 and became one of Sarver's trusted basketball advisors. Kerr announced his retirement from the Suns in June 2010. Afterwards, Kerr returned as a color commentator for NBA on TNT until 2014, when he pursued a career in coaching. On May 14, 2014, the Golden State Warriors named Kerr the team's head coach. On April 4, 2015, with a win over the Dallas Mavericks, Kerr broke the NBA record for the most regular-season wins for a rookie coach. The Warriors went on to win the 2015 NBA Finals, making Kerr the first rookie coach to win a championship since Pat Riley in the 1982 NBA Finals. On April 13, 2016, the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in an NBA season, breaking a record previously held by Kerr's 1995–96 Chicago Bulls. The Warriors returned to the Finals for four straight years, losing in 2016, winning again in 2017 and 2018, and losing in 2019. Kerr was born in Beirut, Lebanon to Malcolm H. Kerr, an American academic who specialized in the Middle East, and his wife, Ann (Zwicker).[2] He has three siblings.[3] His grandfather, Stanley Kerr, volunteered with the Near East Relief after the Armenian Genocide and rescued women and orphans in Aleppo and Marash before eventually settling in Beirut.[4] Kerr spent much of his childhood in Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries. He attended Cairo American College in Egypt, the American Community School in Beirut, Lebanon, and Palisades High School (now Palisades Charter High School) in Los Angeles, graduating in 1983. Malcolm Kerr was killed by members of the Shia Lebanese militia called Islamic Jihad on the morning of January 18, 1984 at the age of 52 while he was serving as president of the American University of Beirut.[5][6][7][8] He was shot twice in the back of his head, by gunmen using suppressed handguns, in the hallway outside his office.[3][6][7][8] Kerr was 18 years old at the time, and a college freshman;[5] regarding his father's death, he has said: ""Before my father was killed, my life was impenetrable. Bad things happened to other people.""[2] The Kerr family sued the Iranian government under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.[9] While warming up with the Arizona Wildcats for a game at arch-rival Arizona State in 1988, Kerr had to deal with many ASU Sun Devil fans in the crowd chanting ""PLO"" and ""your father's history.""[10][11] Though tearful, Kerr led the Wildcats to victory, scoring 20 points in the first half, making all six of his three-point attempts.[11] The athletic director of Arizona State, Charles Harris, sent a letter of apology to Kerr a few days later.[12] Kerr graduated from the University of Arizona in 1988 with a Bachelor of General Studies, with emphasis on history, sociology and English.[13][14] Minimally recruited out of high school, Kerr played basketball for the University of Arizona from 1983 to 1988. In the summer of 1986, Kerr was named to the USA Basketball team that competed in the FIBA World Championship in Spain. The team was the last American Men's Senior Team composed strictly of amateur players to capture a gold medal. He blew out his knee in the tournament, usually a career-ending injury, forcing him to miss an entire season (1986–87) at Arizona.[15] He helped the Wildcats reach the Final Four of the NCAA Division I basketball tournament in 1988 along with fellow All-American teammate Sean Elliott. Kerr also set an NCAA record for 3-point percentage in a season (114–199, 57.3%). Kerr was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the second round of the 1988 NBA draft. He was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 1989. He spent over three seasons (1989–1992) there and then part of the 1992–93 season with the Orlando Magic. In 1993, he signed with the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls made the playoffs in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons, but without Michael Jordan's presence for all of 1994 and much of 1995, the team could not advance to the Finals. However, with Jordan back full-time for the 1995–96 season, the Bulls set a then NBA-record of 72–10 and defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1996 NBA Finals. Kerr played a major part of the Bulls' championship victory in the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. In the final seconds of Game 6 with the score tied at 86, he took a pass from Jordan and hit the title-winner. The Bulls won, earning the franchise's fifth title. Kerr also won the 3-Point Shootout at the 1997 All-Star Game. In the last minute of Game 2 of the 1998 NBA Finals against Utah, Kerr missed a 3-pointer, grabbed his own rebound and made a pass to Jordan who made a crucial three-point play, putting them in the lead for good. The play helped Chicago win the game and tie the series at 1. The Bulls won the series in 6 games. In January 1999, Kerr was acquired by the San Antonio Spurs in a sign-and-trade deal with the Bulls, whereby Chuck Person and a first-round pick in the 2000 NBA draft was sent to Chicago.[16] The Spurs reached 1999 NBA Finals and won their first NBA Championship with a 4–1 series victory over the New York Knicks. Kerr became the second player to win four straight NBA titles without being a part of the 1960s Boston Celtics dynasty (the other being Frank Saul, who won four straight with Rochester and Minneapolis from 1951 to 1954.[17] Kerr and Saul were the only two players in NBA history to have won two championships with two different teams in consecutive seasons until Patrick McCaw achieved the same feat in 2019.[18][19]). Kerr was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers alongside Derek Anderson on July 24, 2001 in a deal that brought Steve Smith to the Spurs. He would remain in Portland for the 2001–02 season, playing in 65 games. On August 2, 2002, Kerr was traded back to San Antonio along with Erick Barkley and a 2003 second-round pick. In return, the Trail Blazers received Charles Smith, Amal McCaskill, and Antonio Daniels. Kerr played in nearly every game (75) the following year, which was his final season in the league.[20] In Game Six of the 2003 Western Conference Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, Kerr made four second-half three-pointers that helped eliminate Dallas. The Spurs eventually won the NBA championship by beating the New Jersey Nets in the 2003 NBA Finals, 4–2. Kerr announced his retirement after the 2003 NBA Finals. During his NBA career, he played 910 regular-season games. He retired as the league's all-time leader in single-season three-point shooting percentage (.524 in 1994–95) and career three-point shooting percentage (.454). Kerr won a total of five NBA championships as a player. In 2003, Kerr became a broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT), offering commentary alongside renowned analyst Marv Albert. During his tenure, he performed a segment sponsored by Coors Light called Steve's Refreshing Thoughts in which he brought up interesting facts in NBA history. This segment continued through sponsorship, and became known as Steve Wonders, sponsored by Sprint. In the same time period, Kerr also contributed to Yahoo! as an NBA commentator. He has provided his voice for the in-game commentary of EA Sports video games NBA Live 06, NBA Live 07, NBA Live 08, NBA Live 09 and NBA Live 10 with Albert. He has also provided his voice as a color analyst for NBA 2K12, NBA 2K13, NBA 2K14 and NBA 2K15. He remained a commentator in NBA 2K15 despite becoming the Golden State Warriors coach for the 2014–15 season several months prior to the game's release. Kerr left broadcasting in 2007 to become general manager for the Phoenix Suns, but it was confirmed on June 28, 2010 that he would return as an NBA analyst for TNT starting with the 2010–11 NBA season. Since 2011, Kerr has also called the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship on Turner Sports and CBS, teaming up with lead broadcasters Jim Nantz and Clark Kellogg for the First Four and Final Four games, and with Albert in other rounds. Kerr was a regular contributor to the website Grantland from 2011 until it closed in 2015. On April 15, 2004, Kerr was announced as a member of a potential group of buyers that would acquire his old team, the Phoenix Suns, from Jerry Colangelo for $300 million. He became part of Suns management, acting as a consultant.[21][22] During the 2006 NBA All-Star Weekend, he was a member of the San Antonio team that won the Shooting Stars Competition.[23] On June 2, 2007, Kerr announced that he would become the general manager of the Phoenix Suns beginning with the 2007–2008 season. In 2008, the Suns traded forward Shawn Marion and guard Marcus Banks to the Miami Heat in exchange for Shaquille O'Neal. The Suns were eliminated by the San Antonio Spurs in five games in the first round of the playoffs. On December 10, 2008, Kerr continued to remake the Suns roster by trading Boris Diaw, Raja Bell, and Sean Singletary to the Charlotte Bobcats in exchange for Jason Richardson, Jared Dudley, and the Bobcats' 2010 second-round draft pick, which was used to draft Gani Lawal of Georgia Tech.[24] On June 25, 2009, Kerr traded O'Neal to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Ben Wallace, Sasha Pavlovic, a future second-round draft pick and cash. On May 5, 2010, the Suns wore Los Suns jerseys in Game 2 against the Spurs to be united against the controversial Arizona immigration law. Kerr himself compared the law to Nazi Germany.[25] On June 15, 2010, Kerr stepped down as president and general manager of the Suns. He continued to own a one percent share of the Suns' organization until 2014.[citation needed] On May 14, 2014, Kerr reached an agreement to become the head coach for the Golden State Warriors, succeeding Mark Jackson.[26][27] Kerr coached in the 2014 Summer League for the Warriors. During the 2014–15 season, the team's offense employed elements of the triangle offense from his playing days in Chicago under Phil Jackson, the spacing and pace of Gregg Popovich in San Antonio, and the uptempo principles Mike D'Antoni and later Alvin Gentry used in Phoenix when Kerr was the GM.[28][29] After the Warriors beat the Houston Rockets to win their 14th consecutive game, Kerr became the first coach to start his career with a 19–2 record.[30] This beat out Al Cervi and his 18–2 start with the Syracuse Nationals. On December 10, 2014, Kerr became the first NBA rookie head coach to win 21 of his first 23 games.[31] He was named the head coach of the Western Conference team for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game after Golden State had the best record in the conference.[32] On April 4, the Warriors beat the Dallas Mavericks 123–110 to clinch home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, and Kerr got his 63rd win of the season to become the highest winning rookie head coach in NBA history, passing Tom Thibodeau and his 62 wins with the Chicago Bulls in the 2010–11 season. In the NBA Coach of the Year voting, Kerr was runner-up to Mike Budenholzer. The Warriors ultimately finished with one of the best regular seasons in NBA history, and the greatest in the team's 69-year history. Golden State ended with an overall record of 67–15, becoming the 10th team to win 67 or more games in a single season. It was the first time the Warriors had ever won as many as 60 games in a season; their previous high was 59 in the 1975–76 season. The Warriors also ended with a 39–2 home record, which is tied for the second best home record in NBA history. The Warriors were first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving–led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. They became the first team in NBA history to have two win streaks over 15 at home (18 and 19). In the opening round of the playoffs against the New Orleans Pelicans, Kerr led the Warriors to their first four-game playoff sweep since the 1975 NBA Finals. Afterwards, the team surpassed the Memphis Grizzlies (4–2, in the second round). Down 2–1 in the series, Kerr made an unconventional adjustment in Game 4 to leave the Grizzlies' Tony Allen open and have his defender, center Andrew Bogut, guard the interior. His strategy was lauded after Allen, Memphis' best wing defender, was benched and limited to 16 minutes after missing wide open shots.[33][34][35] The Warriors then defeated the Houston Rockets (4–1, in the Western Conference Finals), making the NBA Finals for the first time in 40 years. The Warriors faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals. Kerr and rival coach David Blatt were both in their first season as NBA head coaches, and this was the first time a pair of rookie head coaches faced each other in the NBA Finals since the NBA's first year of existence, in 1947 with Eddie Gottlieb of the Philadelphia Warriors and Harold Olsen of the Chicago Stags competing.[36] After the Warriors went down 2–1 to Cleveland, Kerr started swingman Andre Iguodala in place of Bogut, jump-starting their stagnant offense for a 103–82 road win that evened the series. It was Iguodala's first start of the season, and the small unit came to be known as the Death Lineup. After the game, Kerr admitted to lying to the press in response to pregame questions about potential changes to his starting lineup.[37] The Warriors went on to win the championship in six games, defeating the Cavaliers, 4–2, in the series, to give Kerr his sixth championship and first as a head coach. After the first two days of the defending champion Warriors' training camp, Kerr took an indefinite leave of absence to rehabilitate his back, which had caused problems since the 2015 NBA Finals.[38] Around this time, assistant coach Luke Walton assumed Kerr's coaching duties. Kerr missed all of 2015 and most of January 2016, although technically the NBA credited Walton's win-loss record to Kerr.[39] Kerr said ""I think it's ridiculous"", when asked about getting all of Walton's wins.[40] On January 22, 2016, Kerr returned to coaching after missing 43 games, but warned he might need to miss games occasionally if there was a recurrence of the headaches and pain related to the spinal fluid leak that sidelined him. The Warriors went 39–4 with interim coach Luke Walton.[41] The Warriors went 34-5 after Kerr returned to coaching. Golden State broke the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls 72–10 record by winning 73 games.[42] Kerr became the first person in NBA history to be a part of 70-win teams as a player and head coach. He was named 2015–16 NBA Coach of the Year.[43] Kerr would lead the Warriors to the 2016 NBA Finals where they would again face the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Warriors lost in seven games. On November 20, 2016, the NBA announced that Kerr had been fined $25,000 for public criticism of officiating during a radio interview with KNBR 680 on November 17.[44] Kerr missed time during the 2017 playoffs due to recurring back issues.[45] Associate head coach Mike Brown has acted as acting head coach during periods of Kerr's absence, and Brown continued head coaching into the playoffs leading the Warriors to a 12–0 record in the postseason. Kerr returned for the 2017 NBA Finals where he led the Warriors to victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. The Warriors finished the playoffs with a 16–1 record, the best postseason winning percentage in NBA history.[46] Kerr is the fourth coach in NBA history to win two championships in his first three seasons of coaching. Kerr won his third championship as a head coach when the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2018 NBA Finals in four games to give Kerr his eighth championship of his career. Kerr is third on the Warriors' all-time wins list behind Don Nelson and Eddie Gottlieb, and only Nelson has won more games in the West Coast portion of Warriors history.[citation needed] He also became the first head coach in NBA History to have led his team towards 67 or more wins in three consecutive seasons.[47] Since the conclusion of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Kerr has been critical of Donald Trump and his election victory. In an interview following the election, Kerr voiced the opinion that Trump's rise to power was based on insults against women and minorities. He compared Trump's campaign performances and the crude responses of his supporters to The Jerry Springer Show. Although he expressed hope that Trump would be a good president, he made clear his ""disgust"" with Trump's disrespectful public discourse and his disappointment with the election results.[48] Kerr has been a strong supporter of gun control, expressing disappointment with the government’s response to school shootings.[49] Kerr did not want to talk about the human rights violations in the China.[50][51] President Donald Trump said: ""I watch the way that Kerr, Popovich, and some of the others were pandering to China and yet to our own country, they don't - it's like they don't respect it.""[51] Kerr married Margot Kerr, his college sweetheart, in 1990. They have three children: Nick, Maddy and Matthew.[52]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/167.png
168,Jason Kidd,"March 23, 1973",,"Saint Joseph of Notre Dame in Alameda, California",California,2014,2018,5,true,,"""[3, 1]""",/coaches/kiddja01c.html,"Jason Frederick Kidd (born March 23, 1973) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Previously a point guard in the NBA, Kidd was a 10-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA First Team member, and a nine-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. He won an NBA Championship in 2011 as a member of the Dallas Mavericks, and was a two-time Olympic Gold Medal winner during his pro career, as part of Team USA in 2000 and 2008. He was inducted as a player into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Kidd played college basketball for the California Golden Bears and was drafted second overall by the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the 1994 NBA draft. He was named co-NBA Rookie of the Year in his first season with the Mavericks. Then, from 1996 to 2001, Kidd played for the Phoenix Suns and later for the New Jersey Nets from 2001 to 2008. He led the Nets to two consecutive NBA Finals appearances in 2002 and 2003. In the middle of the 2007–08 season, Kidd was traded back to Dallas. At age 38, Kidd won his only NBA championship when Dallas defeated Miami in the 2011 NBA Finals. He finished his playing career in 2013 with the New York Knicks. The following season, he became the head coach of the Nets, who had relocated from New Jersey to Brooklyn. After one season, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, where he coached for four seasons until he was fired mid-season in 2018. Kidd's ability to pass and rebound made him a regular triple-double threat, and he retired ranked third all-time in the NBA for regular season triple-doubles with a career total of 107[1] and third in playoff triple-doubles with a career total of 11.[2] He ranks second on the NBA all-time lists in career assists and steals and ninth in 3-point field goals made.[3] Kidd was born in San Francisco, and raised in an upper middle class section of Oakland. His father, Steve, was African-American, and his mother, Anne, is Irish-American.[citation needed] As a youth, Kidd was highly scouted for AAU teams and tourneys, garnering various all-star and MVP awards. He attended the East Oakland Youth Development Center and frequented the city courts of Oakland, where he often found himself pitted against future NBA Hall of Famer Gary Payton. At St. Joseph Notre Dame High School in Alameda, under the guidance of coach Frank LaPorte, Kidd led the Pilots to consecutive state championships, averaging 25 points, 10 assists, 7 rebounds and 7 steals his senior season. During that year, he also received a host of individual honors, including the Naismith Award as the nation's top high school player, and was named Player of the Year by PARADE and USA Today. The all-time prep leader in assists (1,155) and the state's seventh-highest career scorer (2,661 points), Kidd was voted California Player of the Year for the second time and also a McDonald's All-American. On January 31, 2012, Kidd was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All Americans.[4] After a highly publicized recruiting process, Kidd shocked many fans and pundits alike by choosing to attend the nearby University of California, Berkeley—a school that was coming off a 10–18 season and had not won a conference title since 1960—over a number of top-ranked collegiate programs including the University of Arizona, the University of Kentucky, the University of Kansas, and Ohio State University. In his first year playing for the Golden Bears, Kidd averaged 13.0 points, 7.7 assists, 4.9 rebounds, and 3.8 steals per game which earned him national Freshman of the Year honors and a spot on the All-Pac-10 team. His 110 steals set an NCAA record for most steals by a freshman and set school record for most steals in a season, while his 220 assists that season was also a school record. His play was also a key factor in the resurgence of Cal basketball and helped the Golden Bears earn an NCAA Tournament bid, where they upset two-time defending national champion Duke in the second round of that tournament before losing to Kansas in the Sweet 16. Kidd continued his success as a sophomore, tallying averages of 16.7 points, 6.9 rebounds, 3.1 steals and 9.1 assists, breaking his previous school record for most assists in a season with 272, while also leading the nation in that category. He was also selected a First Team All-American, the first Cal player to be so named since 1968, as well as Pac-10 Player of the Year, becoming the first sophomore to receive that honor. The Golden Bears made the NCAA Tournament again as a fifth seed, but was upset in the first round by Dick Bennett's Wisconsin–Green Bay team 61–57. Kidd was also named a finalist for both the Naismith and Wooden Awards as college basketball's top player and subsequently opted to enter the NBA draft in 1994. In 2004, Cal retired Kidd's number 5 jersey. Kidd was selected as the second pick overall by the Dallas Mavericks, behind Glenn Robinson of Purdue, and just ahead of Duke's Grant Hill. In his first year, he averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists, and led the NBA in triple doubles, sharing 1995 NBA Rookie of the Year honors with Hill of the Detroit Pistons.[5] The year before the Mavericks drafted Kidd, they finished the season with the worst record in the NBA at 13–69. After Kidd's first season with the Mavericks, their record improved to 36–46 which was the largest improvement in the NBA. In the following season Kidd was voted a starter in the 1996 All-Star Game. In his first two years with the Mavericks, the move most people associated him with was ""the baseball pass"". Kidd was a member of the ""Three J's"" in Dallas along with Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn. After promising beginnings, things turned sour among the trio. Mashburn's injury combined with deteriorated personal relations between the immature leaders of the team resulted in the Mavericks taking a step backwards instead of further development. Kidd's continued problems with the coaches affected the Mavericks' decision to trade their young star just in his third season in the league.[6] Kidd was traded to the Phoenix Suns with Tony Dumas and Loren Meyer for Michael Finley, A. C. Green, and Sam Cassell during the 1996–97 season. In his first full season with the Suns in 1997–98, the team's win total improved by 16 games.[7] The Suns, who finished the season with a 56–26 record, had been recognized for their fast-paced style of play with Kidd frequently leading a small lineup of four guards (Kidd, Kevin Johnson, Rex Chapman and Steve Nash) being on the floor at the same time together with Antonio McDyess playing at center.[8] In the 1998–99 season, Kidd averaged 10.8 assists per game to dethrone Washington's Rod Strickland as the league's assists leader. He also led the NBA with seven triple-doubles (the rest of the league had just 11) and was second in the NBA with 41.2 minutes per game (behind Allen Iverson's 41.5 mpg). Kidd averaged career highs in points (16.9 ppg), field goal percentage (.444), rebounds (6.8 rpg, best among NBA guards) and steals (2.28 spg, fourth in the NBA) and was the only player to be ranked among the top 50 in the NBA in 10 different statistical categories. The Suns won all seven of the games in which he had triple-doubles.[9] The Suns acquired Penny Hardaway from the Orlando Magic before the start of the 1999–00 season in hope of creating the best backcourt duo in the league. The combination of Kidd and Hardaway in the starting lineup was often labeled as the BackCourt 2000.[10] Despite a decent 53–29 record, the Suns' season was spoiled by injuries to both of their superstars. Kidd, who broke his ankle late in the regular season, returned during the playoffs to help his team to beat the defending champion San Antonio Spurs and advance to the second round for the first time in his career.[11] The 2000–01 season was affected by Kidd's personal problems as he was charged with domestic abuse of his wife.[12] The Suns, who struggled in the middle part of the season, finished strongly with a 15–6 record to secure another 50-win season. Kidd took on more of the offensive load after his teammates encouraged him to be more selfish. He recorded 30-plus points six times on the year and five times in the last 19 games. In one particular hot stretch, he scored 36, 32 and 31 in three consecutive games in mid-March, prior to which he had never recorded consecutive 30-point games.[13] During his stay in Phoenix, Kidd made the All-Star Game in 1998, 2000, and 2001 (in 1999 it was not held because of a lockout) and led the NBA in assists for three consecutive years (1999–2001). It was also with the Suns that Kidd rose to the status of the league's best playmaker as he was voted to the All-NBA First Team three years in a row (1999–2001). On June 28, 2001, after five seasons in Phoenix in which the team made the playoffs each year, he was traded, along with Chris Dudley, to the New Jersey Nets for Stephon Marbury, Johnny Newman, and Soumaila Samake. Kidd joined the franchise as the team was constructed around a sophomore Kenyon Martin, veterans Kerry Kittles and Keith Van Horn, along with the rookies Richard Jefferson, Jason Collins, and Brandon Armstrong coming from the draft-day trade for the 7th pick Eddie Griffin. The 2001–02 season saw Kidd lead the Nets to a 52–30 finish, a 26-game improvement from the season before and the first 50-win season in the franchise's NBA history.[7] He was voted to the All-NBA First Team and finished second to the Spurs' Tim Duncan in MVP voting. Many critics and fans have argued that Kidd deserved to win the award because of his impact in New Jersey—transforming the Nets from perennial league doormats into championship contenders seemingly in the space of a single training camp. Under Kidd's guidance, the young Nets team prospered through the playoffs, won the Eastern Conference title and advanced to the franchise's first-ever appearance in the NBA Finals. Along the way they had some memorable moments including a double overtime victory against the Indiana Pacers in the decisive Game 5 (NBA used to have a 2–2–1 format for the playoffs first round back then). Indiana's Reggie Miller forced the first overtime with a 35-foot 3-pointer at the buzzer and the second one with a two-handed dunk, but the Nets eventually survived and beat Indiana 120–109. Kidd scored 20 of his then playoffs-best 31 points in the 4th quarter and overtimes.[14] After defeating the Charlotte Hornets 4–1 in the second round, the Nets then faced the Boston Celtics in the Conference Finals. In that series Kidd and the Nets experienced the biggest 4th quarter collapse in the playoffs history, when the Celtics came back from a 21-point deficit to win the pivotal Game 3, taking a 2–1 series lead.[15] However, the Nets then won three consecutive games, while Kidd averaged a triple double for the entire series.[16] In the NBA Finals the Nets were swept in four games by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers. New Jersey enjoyed another stellar season under Kidd's leadership in the 2002–03 season, during which the team finished 49–33 and reached the NBA finals once again. Kidd had his highest scoring season with 18.7 points per game[17] and led the league in assists with 8.9 per game. This time Kidd was selected to the All-NBA Second Team. In the playoffs after splitting the first four games with the Milwaukee Bucks, the Nets recorded a 10-game winning streak, while sweeping the Celtics and the Detroit Pistons on the way to their second consecutive NBA Finals.[18] In the Finals New Jersey lost to Tim Duncan's San Antonio Spurs in six games, even though the series was tied after the first four games. As an unrestricted free agent in the 2003 offseason, there was speculation that Kidd would join the defending champion Spurs and replace Tony Parker as their starting point guard. Parker, then young and unproven, was perceived to have ""limitations"" in his game that Kidd did not.[19] However, Kidd elected to stay with the Nets on a 6-year, $99 million deal.[20] In the 2003–04 season, Kidd averaged 15.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 9.2 assists (leading the league in assists for the second year in a row). The Nets led by Kidd finished the season 47–35 as their leader was voted to the All-NBA First Team for the fifth time in his career. In the playoffs however, they lost in the Conference Semifinals in a seven-game series against the Detroit Pistons, the eventual champions. Kidd went scoreless in the decisive Game 7, while playing with a serious knee injury.[21] On July 1, 2004, Kidd underwent microfracture surgery to repair a damaged knee. He made a full recovery and returned to the court for the 2004–05 season in December, during which the Nets acquired star swingman Vince Carter from the Toronto Raptors. With the Nets hanging on the prospect of missing the playoffs for the first time since 2001 and with Jefferson injured, Carter and Kidd combined to fuel the team to a late regular season surge that enabled them to inch past the Cleveland Cavaliers for the eighth and final playoff berth in the East. The Nets were eliminated in four games to the top-seeded Miami Heat in the first round. In the 2005–06 season, Kidd averaged 13.3 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 8.4 assists. He and Carter led the Nets to a third-place finish in the East with a 49–33 record to clinch their fourth Atlantic Division title in the last five seasons. In April the Nets recorded NBA season-best winning streak, which was ended by the Cleveland Cavaliers at 14 wins in a row. Kidd was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team for the fourth time in his career. In the playoffs the Nets beat the Indiana Pacers in six games in the first round, but later in the Conference Semifinal they were defeated again by the Miami Heat, the eventual champions. Kidd was named a reserve for the NBA All-Star game along with teammate Vince Carter during the 2006–07 season. However, Kidd missed the game because of a strained back and was replaced on the roster by Joe Johnson.[22] On April 7, 2007, Kidd and Carter became the first teammates to record triple-doubles in the same game since Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen did it in 1989 for the Chicago Bulls. In the first round of the 2006–07 postseason Kidd averaged 14.0 points, 13.2 assists, 10.0 rebounds, and 2.0 steals, as the Nets defeated the Toronto Raptors in six games. He joined Wilt Chamberlain and Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history to average a triple-double in multiple playoff series.[23] For the postseason, Kidd averaged 14.6 points, 10.9 assists and 10.9 rebounds in twelve playoff games.[24] He became the second player in NBA history to average a triple-double for an entire postseason.[25] Despite Kidd's efforts the Nets were eliminated in six games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals by the Cleveland Cavaliers. In the 2007–08 season, Kidd became the third player to get a triple-double in three straight games since 1989. He did so after he logged his 97th career triple-double in a 115–99 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats.[26] Kidd was voted by the fans to start in the 2008 All-Star game in New Orleans as a guard along with Dwyane Wade. During that season Kidd had been mentioned in trade rumors, notably to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the deal fell through when the Lakers refused to give up their young center Andrew Bynum. On January 28, 2008, Kidd revealed that his agent had been talking to the Nets' front office about a trade. On February 19, 2008, Kidd was traded[27] to the Dallas Mavericks, the team that originally drafted him. On February 13, 2008, the Dallas Mavericks and New Jersey Nets reached an agreement on a trade to send Kidd and Malik Allen to Dallas for Devin Harris, Devean George, Jerry Stackhouse, DeSagana Diop, Maurice Ager, two first-round drafts picks (in 2008 and 2010), and $3 million, but the trade fell through when George invoked his (Early) Bird rights, as was stipulated in his contract at the time.[28][29] The trade was retooled, with Trenton Hassell replacing George, and Keith Van Horn, who had agreed to come out of retirement, replacing Stackhouse, because NBA officials informed the Mavericks that if Stackhouse were to be included in the deal, he could not re-sign with the team if the Nets chose to buy out his contract.[30] Antoine Wright was also added to the retooled trade proposal (the two teams originally agreed on a separate deal that would have sent Wright to the Mavericks for a 2008 second-round pick, but were ultimately able include him in the Kidd deal).[31] On February 19, 2008, Kidd was traded to the Mavericks along with Allen and Wright for Van Horn (via a sign and trade deal), Harris, Diop, Hassell, Ager, $3 million, and first round picks in 2008 and 2010.[32][33] The Mavericks hoped that Kidd would provide leadership to the team that for years had been labelled as weak mentally and help Dallas and its franchise-player Dirk Nowitzki to win their first ever NBA Championship.[33] Although already a member of the Mavericks, Kidd started for the Eastern Conference in the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, as he had already been named as a starter prior to the trade. The Mavericks made a strong playoff push following the trade, but despite a 51–31 record, they were only able to secure the seventh seed in the highly competitive Western Conference. In the playoffs, they faced Chris Paul's New Orleans Hornets, and were eliminated in five games in the first round. The following 2008–09 season saw Kidd and the Mavericks stumble out to a rocky start, losing eight out of the first 15 games; however, the team finished the season strong to earn the sixth seed in the playoffs with a 50–32 record. Kidd finished the season ranked third in the league in steals with 2.0 per game, his best average in six years. In the playoffs, the Mavericks upset the San Antonio Spurs, with Kidd leading the team in assists in all but one game; the Mavericks reached the Conference Semifinals for the first time since 2006. Kidd's season ended there as the Mavs lost to the Denver Nuggets in five games. On July 5, 2009, Kidd verbally committed to re-signing with the Mavericks after being pursued heavily by the New York Knicks. The three-year deal reportedly was worth more than $25 million, all of it fully guaranteed.[34] In the first year of Kidd's new contract in the 2009–10 season the Mavericks finished second in the Western Conference with a 55–27 record during the regular season. However, the season ended with another disappointment as the Mavericks lost in six games to the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2010 NBA Playoffs. It was rumored that Kidd had gone through a flu just before the series began which might have affected his physical conditions. He did not speak to reporters after Games 5 and 6 and skipped the team's final meeting.[35] Kidd won the NBA championship with the Dallas Mavericks on June 12, 2011, defeating NBA All-Stars LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh and the Miami Heat. After appearing and losing in two different NBA finals, it was the first and only championship in his career. Despite a mid-season injury to Dirk Nowitzki, and a season-ending surgery to their starting small forward Caron Butler, the 2010–11 season turned out to be the best for the Mavs in the Kidd's era as they finished the regular season with a 57–25 record. On February 4, Kidd hit a 3-pointer with 2.5 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to give the Mavs a win in Boston over the Celtics, extending their winning streak to seven games.[36] Kidd sparked the Mavericks' impressive run with a total of 42 points in the first two playoff games against the Portland Trail Blazers.[37] Dallas won the series 4–2. The Mavs then swept the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, with Kidd successfully guarding Kobe Bryant in decisive moments of close games 1 and 3.[38] In the Western Conference Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Kidd was partly responsible for guarding young and athletic superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. Kidd hit a tie-breaking 3-pointer late in overtime in a Game 4 victory at Oklahoma City to give his team a 3–1 lead.[39] Dallas defeated Oklahoma in five games. In the NBA Finals, the Mavericks defeated the Miami Heat in six games, despite being down after the first three. Kidd averaged 9.3 points, 7.3 assists, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.9 steals per game during the Mavericks' 21-game championship run. At 38 years of age, he became the oldest starting point guard ever to lead his team to the championship.[40] Shortened by a lockout the 2011–12 season turned out to be the last for Kidd in the Mavericks uniform. With 39-year-old Kidd averaging career lows in minutes, points and assists for the regular season, the defending champions were swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the 2012 NBA playoffs. On July 12, 2012, Kidd signed with the New York Knicks.[41] After making a verbal commitment to re-sign with the Mavericks, Kidd changed his mind and decided to sign a 3-year deal with the Knicks.[42] Kidd was expected to act as a mentor to Jeremy Lin but after Lin left to the Houston Rockets, it was assumed that Kidd would serve as a backup to Raymond Felton at the point guard position.[43] During the preseason however, the Knicks head coach Mike Woodson decided to start the season with both playmakers in the starting lineup and Kidd adjusting more to the shooting guard role. With the new backcourt duo in the lineup, the Knicks opened the 2012–13 season with an 18–5 record while Kidd averaging 9.0 points per game on 44 percent three-point shooting in the first two months of the season. Nearly 40 years old, Kidd was asked to play almost 33 minutes per game in December. New York finished the season with 54 wins, an 18-game jump from the previous season. It was their first 50-win season since 1999–2000. The Knicks advanced to the second round of the playoffs, but lost to the Indiana Pacers in six games. Kidd struggled during the playoffs, when he was held without a field goal in his last 10 playoff games.[7] It was believed that overworking Kidd during the regular season had strongly affected his performance in the second half of the season and left him burned out for the playoffs.[44][45] Kidd retired on June 3, 2013, after one season with the Knicks and 19 seasons in the NBA. His announcement came two days after 1995 co-Rookie of the Year Grant Hill retired.[7] On June 12, 2013, Kidd was named head coach of the Brooklyn Nets, replacing interim coach P. J. Carlesimo.[46] He is the third person since the ABA–NBA merger to debut as an NBA head coach the season after he retired as a player.[a][47] In September 2013, Kidd bought a minority ownership stake in the team (from Jay-Z).[48] On October 17, 2013, the Nets retired and raised his number 5 jersey to the rafters before a preseason game against the Miami Heat.[49] Kidd was suspended for the first two games of the season after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor DWI charge stemming from an incident in July 2012.[50] Joe Prunty served as acting head coach for the team's season opener in Cleveland and their home opener against Miami.[51] He made his debut as head coach on November 3 in a loss to the Orlando Magic. On November 5, Kidd had his first victory as head coach in a 104–88 win over the Utah Jazz. On November 28, Kidd was fined $50,000 by the NBA for instructing his player Tyshawn Taylor to bump into him and intentionally spilling a cup of soda on the court in order to stop the game so his team could draw up a last-second offensive play against the Lakers.[52] After a loss to the Chicago Bulls on Christmas Day, the Nets dropped to a disappointing 9–19 record. Many critics started to question Kidd's ability to manage a group of veterans that included Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Joe Johnson and there even appeared rumours that Kidd might be on his way out before the end of the season.[53] However, the Nets were able to turn things around at the beginning of 2014 and finished the season with a 44–38 record, while Kidd began to get recognition for his coaching skills. On February 3, 2014, Kidd was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for January.[54] On April 1, 2014, he was named Eastern Conference Coach of the Month a second time for March.[55] He became the fourth coach overall to win both Player of the Month and Coach of the Month honors. He also became the second coach, after Jeff Hornacek of the Phoenix Suns, to win both honors with the same team.[56] In the first round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs, the Brooklyn Nets eliminated the Toronto Raptors in a 7-game series. Kidd is the 19th rookie head coach in the league's history to coach his team in a decisive Game 7 on the road, and became the first one to win it.[57] In the semifinals, the Nets faced the Miami Heat and lost the series 4–1. On July 1, 2014, the Milwaukee Bucks secured Kidd's coaching rights from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for two second-round draft picks in 2015 and 2019.[58] The move did not come without controversy, as it was reported that Kidd had been seeking more management power over the Nets' general manager Billy King and after being denied began talks with the Bucks even though they still had a coach under contract in Larry Drew.[59] He later stated that he felt the Nets truly did not want him nor were they committed to building a contender.[60] In his return to Brooklyn on November 19, 2014, he was greeted with heavy boos and jeers.[61] The Bucks were one of the biggest surprises of the 2014–15 season. Under Kidd's guidance the young team improved from franchise-worst 15 wins in the previous season, finishing with a 41–41 record to advance to the playoffs as the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference. Milwaukee achieved that feat despite losing their 2nd draft pick overall Jabari Parker in December to a knee injury and trading star guard Brandon Knight to the Phoenix Suns in February. Kidd is the first coach in NBA history to lead two franchises to the playoffs in his first two years as a head coach.[62] Kidd finished third in voting for the Coach of the Year Award behind Mike Budenholzer and Steve Kerr.[63] The 2015–16 season was less successful for Kidd, as the Bucks finished with a 33–49 record and did not qualify to the playoffs. On December 20, 2015 it was reported that Kidd would be out indefinitely as he would undergo hip surgery on December 21. While Kidd was recovering, his assistant Joe Prunty was acting as an interim coach.[64] On a positive note, Kidd moved rising 21-year old Giannis Antetokounmpo into a point guard position, which helped the young player to record five triple doubles in the season and make progress in most statistical categories. Despite the disappointing season, the Bucks owners issued Kidd a vote of confidence and mentioned a possible prolongation of his contract expiring after the next season.[65] The following season Kidd led the Bucks to a winning record as they qualified to the playoffs for the second time in three years. Kidd had his projected starting unit available for just several minutes during the season. On February 9, the same day the shooting guard Khris Middleton was making his season debut after recovering from a hamstring injury, the power forward Jabari Parker went down with an ACL injury.[66] Despite the setback, Kidd had the Bucks finishing the season strong with a 42–40 record. In the first round of the playoffs against the Toronto Raptors, the Bucks took a 2–1 lead after game 3, but went on to lose the series in six games. On January 22, 2018, the Bucks fired Kidd after the team posted a 23–22 record midway through the 2017–18 season.[67] On July 31, 2019, Kidd was hired as an assistant coach by the Los Angeles Lakers.[68][69] Kidd's first participation in USA basketball came after his first season in college. He was the only freshman chosen to take part in Team USA's 10-member team. The team played five games in Europe and finished with a record of 3–2. Kidd tied for team highs in assists per game with 4.0, and steals per game with 1.4. He also had averages of 8.4 points per game, and 4.2 rebounds per game. Kidd's next stint with USA basketball came in 1999 where he participated in the USA Olympic Qualifying Tournament. The team finished with an undefeated record of 10–0 resulting in a gold medal and earning a berth at the 2000 Olympics. Kidd averaged 7.4 PPG, 6.8 APG, 4.4 RPG, 2.7 SPG and again led the team in APG and SPG. In 2000, Kidd was appointed as one of Team USA's tri-captains for the 2000 Olympics at Sydney. Kidd again led the team to an undefeated record of 8–0 which resulted in team USA winning the gold medal at the Olympic Games. Kidd had averages of 6.0 ppg, 5.3 rpg, and had team highs of 4.4 apg, and 1.1 spg. Kidd also had a FG% of 51.6 and shot 50% from 3-point range. In November 2002, Kidd was selected to participate in the 2002 USA Basketball Men's World Championship Team. However, he had to withdraw from the team due to an injury. Kidd came back the next year and participated at the 2003 FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Puerto Rico. Kidd again led the team to a record of 10–0, bringing home the gold medal and a berth at the 2004 Olympics. Kidd started all 10 games and had averages of 3.4 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 5.9 apg, and 1.2 spg. However, Jason Kidd again had to withdraw from the 2004 Olympic team due to another injury. In 2007, Kidd participated in the FIBA Americas Championship 2007. Kidd helped the team to a 10–0 record where he brought home another gold medal and a berth at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China. Kidd had averages of 1.8 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 4.6 apg, and 1.3 spg. He also shot 60% from the field and 62.5% from 3-point distance. Kidd led the entire tournament with assist-to-turnover ratio of 9.20. With Kidd's help team USA averaged 116.7 ppg, and defeated their opponents by a margin of 39.5 ppg. In 2008, Kidd participated in the 2008 Olympics where the team yet again went undefeated in winning their first gold medal since the 2000 Olympics.[75] The team, given the ""Redeem team"" moniker because of failures in the 2002 FIBA World Championship and 2004 Summer Olympics, were once again crowned to be the best team in world basketball. Overall, Kidd brought home five gold medals as member of the national team: three from Olympic qualifying tournaments, one from the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and one from the 2008 Beijing Olympics.[76] Kidd retired second all-time in NBA history in both assists and steals behind John Stockton. He led the NBA in assists five times. His 107 career triple-doubles are fourth all-time, trailing Russell Westbrook, and Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson. Kidd finished his career with averages of 12.6 points, 8.7 assists, 6.3 rebounds and 1.9 steals in 1,391 regular season games.[7] He impacted games with his accurate passes and by involving his teammates; scoring was not his focus.[77] He is considered by many to be one of the best rebounding guards ever to play in the league,[78][79][80] and ESPN called him ""one of the best passing and rebounding point guards in NBA history.""[7] Although Kidd was considered a poor outside shooter when he began his pro career, he retired ranked third all-time in the NBA in three-point field goals made.[81] The New York Times called his improvement as a shooter ""perhaps Kidd's biggest, and most surprising, transformation"".[77] He considered his NBA championship with Dallas and his two gold medals in the Olympics as tied for the top highlights of his career, followed by the co-Rookie of the Year he shared with Grant Hill.[7] Kidd married his first wife, Joumana, in 1997. In January 2001, he was arrested and pleaded guilty to a domestic abuse charge for assaulting his wife Joumana. As part of his plea, Kidd was ordered to attend anger management classes for six months. Kidd completed the mandatory counseling and continued to attend on his own. He and his wife were both active in their church and were thought to have completely reconciled. The incident, however, would be considered a catalyst for the Suns to trade Kidd to the Nets that year. On January 9, 2007, Kidd filed for divorce, citing ""extreme cruelty"" during their relationship. He contended intense jealousy, paranoia, and the threat of ""false domestic abuse claims"" to the police as reasons for the divorce. On February 15, 2007, Joumana Kidd filed a counterclaim for divorce,[82] claiming that the NBA star—among countless instances of abuse—""broke her rib and damaged her hearing by smashing her head into the console of a car"". The couple have three children: Trey Jason (T.J.), born October 12, 1998, and twins Miah and Jazelle, born September 26, 2001.[83][84] On September 10, 2011, Kidd married Porschla Coleman, a former model.[85] They have two children. On July 15, 2012, Kidd was arrested by Southampton Town police and charged with a misdemeanor of driving while intoxicated.[86] According to police, around 2 a.m. Kidd's vehicle struck a telephone pole and ended up in the woods a few blocks away from his home.[87]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/168.png

He previously spent 18 years in the league as an assistant coach, with his most recent tenure there being with the Utah Jazz, before briefly being a head coach for the Phoenix Suns for a full season. Kokoškov was the first European to be a full-time assistant coach in NCAA Division I college basketball, and the first non-American to hold such a position in the NBA.[2] In 2004, he became the first non-American assistant coach to win an NBA championship, and the first to serve on an NBA All-Star Game coaching staff.[3] He is also the first coach born and raised outside of North America to be hired as a head coach in the NBA. He won EuroBasket 2017, while working as the head coach of the Slovenian men's national team. Kokoškov, a graduate of the University of Belgrade, coached various club teams in Belgrade, and was on the coaching staff of the Yugoslav men's and junior national teams. At the age of 24, Kokoškov became the youngest coach in Yugoslavian basketball history, shortly after suffering serious injuries sustained during an automobile accident, which ended a promising basketball playing career. His savvy, ambitious nature, and command of the English language were factors when he was hired by the University of Missouri's Tigers, as a part of their full-time coaching staff in 1999, making him the first European to hold such a position in NCAA Division I men's college basketball.[2] In 2000, Kokoškov became the first non-American to be hired as a full-time assistant coach in the NBA, by the Los Angeles Clippers, under head coach Alvin Gentry.[2] In 2003, he joined the Detroit Pistons staff of head coach Larry Brown.

171,Lon Kruger,,,,,2001,2003,3,true,,"""[1]""",/coaches/krugelo99c.html,"Lonnie Duane Kruger (born August 19, 1952) is an American college and professional basketball coach who is currently the men's basketball head coach of the University of Oklahoma. Kruger played college basketball for Kansas State University. He has served as the head coach of the University of Texas–Pan American, Kansas State, the University of Florida, the University of Illinois, and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, as well as the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Kruger is one of only two coaches ever (the other being Tubby Smith) to lead five programs to the NCAA Tournament. His teams have participated in 17 NCAA Tournaments, including 2 Final Fours (1994 with Florida; 2016 with Oklahoma). Kruger was born and raised in Silver Lake, Kansas. As a point guard, Kruger led the Kansas State Wildcats to back-to-back Big Eight championships in 1972 and 1973 under coach Jack Hartman. Kruger was named the Big Eight Player of the Year in 1973 and 1974, after being named the Big Eight Sophomore of the Year in 1972. He was also a shortstop on the Kansas State baseball team. He was a ninth-round pick of the Atlanta Hawks in the 1974 NBA Draft.[2] Kruger also tried out with the Detroit Pistons, and played professionally in Israel. He also played a season of minor league baseball in the St. Louis Cardinals organization and was invited to training camp with the Dallas Cowboys as a quarterback.[3] As basketball coach of the Wildcats, he led K-State to the NCAA Tournament in each of his four seasons as head coach and the Elite Eight in 1988—a team featuring future NBA players Mitch Richmond and Steve Henson—before losing to arch-rival Kansas Jayhawks, the eventual national champion. From Kansas State, Kruger moved south to the University of Florida, taking over a Gators program that had limited success not only nationally, but in the Southeastern Conference. In his six seasons with Florida, he compiled a 104-80 mark. In the process, he led the University of Florida to its first-ever Final Four appearance in 1994. He was named coach of the year in both 1992 and 1994. From there, he accepted the vacant position at Illinois. While there, he became the only Big Ten coach to successfully sign three consecutive Illinois Mr. Basketball winners, after inking Sergio McClain, Frank Williams, and Brian Cook between 1997 and 1999. Kruger accepted the job at UNLV in 2004. His son, Kevin, took advantage of a new NCAA rule, called Proposal 2005-54,[4] before the 2006–2007 season to transfer from Arizona State and immediately play for his father at UNLV without sitting out one year. The controversial rule was repealed for the following season due to what some claimed were the unintended consequence of allowing players with undergraduate diplomas to immediately begin playing for another school without sitting out for any time.[5] In 2007, Kruger led the Runnin' Rebels to the Sweet Sixteen of the 2007 NCAA Tournament, which was the team's first trip there since Jerry Tarkanian led them there in 1991. On February 9, 2008, the UNLV Runnin' Rebels beat Colorado State 68–51 at home, for Kruger's 400th career win. On April 1, 2011, sources confirmed that Kruger had accepted the head coaching position with the Oklahoma Sooners, replacing the fired Jeff Capel.[6][7][8] Kruger's new Oklahoma Sooners compensation package purportedly exceed $2.2 million annually.[8] Despite his success, he was not immune to criticism, having won just one regular season conference championship in his lengthy college coaching career (Illinois tied for the Big 10 title in 1997-98).[9][10] However, Kruger has generally enjoyed a positive reputation overall.[11] On November 30, 2012, Kruger earned his 500th career head coaching victory as his Sooners beat Northwestern State 69-65 in Norman.[12] On March 17, 2013, Kruger became the only head coach in Division I history to lead five programs to the NCAA tournament when his Sooner team was named a 10 seed in the event's South region.[13] The feat was later matched by Tubby Smith in 2016 when he took Texas Tech to the tournament. On March 20, 2015, Kruger became the only head coach in Division I history to win an NCAA tournament game with five programs. He is one of four active coaches who have had three teams in the Elite Eight.[14] He reached his second career Final Four with Oklahoma in 2016. Prior to accepting the head coaching position at UNLV in 2004, Kruger was the head coach of the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA. It was as head coach of the Hawks that Kruger guaranteed season-ticket holders in 2003 that the Hawks would make the playoffs or get a $125 refund. The Hawks failed to make the playoffs and Kruger was fired midway through the 2002-2003 season. Kruger was an assistant coach under Rudy Tomjanovich for the US national team in the 1998 FIBA World Championship, winning the bronze medal.[15]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/171.png

He primarily grew up in Shelby, Montana, and his step-mother did not approve of Larry playing sports.[4] At the age of 15, Larry moved out of Shelby and finished his high school career at Big Sky High School in Missoula.[7] During this time he lived with his older brother Bernie,[4] who became Larry's legal guardian.[5] Krystkowiak played college basketball for the University of Montana from 1982 to 1986 and still holds the school records for career points scored (2,017) and rebounds (1,105).[8] He is the only person to have been named Big Sky Conference MVP three times (1984–1986).[9] Krystkowiak was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the 2nd round (28th overall pick) of the 1986 NBA draft. He played power forward for nine seasons in the NBA, spending the bulk of his career with the Milwaukee Bucks. He also played for the San Antonio Spurs, Utah Jazz, Orlando Magic, Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. In the 1988–89 season he averaged 12.7 points, 7.6 rebounds, 1.3 assists and over 30 minutes per game for the Bucks.[3] Over his NBA career, he averaged 8.1 points and 4.9 rebounds per contest.[3] Krystkowiak began his coaching career in 1998 as an assistant to Don Holst at his alma mater, the University of Montana. He coached at Montana until 2000 when he left to join Old Dominion as an assistant under former Griz head coach, Blaine Taylor.[9] He spent one season (2001–2002) at Old Dominion. Krystkowiak got his first opportunity as a head coach with the CBA's Idaho Stampede in 2003–04. In his single season as the Stampede's head coach, he led the team to a 37–16 record and a CBA championship game berth.[8] He was hired as head men's basketball coach at the University of Montana in May 2004. He led the Griz to a 42–20 overall record over the course of the next two seasons, reaching the NCAA tournament each year as a result of winning the Big Sky Conference tourney. In 2006 the Grizzlies beat heavily favored, fifth seed, Nevada, in the NCAA Tournament. In June 2006 Krystkowiak left Montana to take a job as an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks under Terry Stotts. Krystkowiak was responsible for working with the Milwaukee's big men, notably second year players Andrew Bogut and Charlie Villanueva.[10] He was named head coach of the team on March 14, 2007, after Stotts was fired. Stotts had led the Bucks to a 23–41 record during the 2006–07 season.[11] He signed a reported 4-year contract with the Bucks, with an average annual salary of $2 million[12] Krystkowiak's NBA head coaching debut on March 15, 2007, resulted in a 101–90 victory over the San Antonio Spurs. On April 17, 2008, Krystkowiak was fired as Milwaukee Bucks head coach after a disappointing season in which the Bucks compiled the league's sixth worst record.[13] In July 2010 Krystkowiak joined the New Jersey Nets coaching staff alongside Avery Johnson and Sam Mitchell.[14] On April 3, 2011, it was announced that Krystkowiak would take over the head coaching position for the University of Utah men's basketball team, as they transitioned into Utah's first season in the newly realigned Pac-12.[4] After Krystkowiak was named Utah's head coach, eight (8) players left the program to play elsewhere and he was forced to bring in several junior college and walk-on players to fill his depleted roster. In a season where starting center David Foster missed the entire season and starting point guard Josh ""Jiggy"" Watkins was dismissed halfway through, Krystkowiak and the Utes struggled to a 6-25 finish, including only three wins against their new Pac-12 opponents. The 2012–2013 season showed much improvement for Krystkowiak's Utes. The additions of freshmen Jordan Loveridge and Brandon Taylor, as well as great play and leadership from senior center Jason Washburn, would help Utah more than double their win total from the previous season. On March 9, 2013, Utah closed out its season by defeating No. 19 Oregon, celebrating Senior Night at the Huntsman Center with the program's first victory over a ranked opponent since 2009. Utah then defeated USC and California in the first and second rounds of the Pac-12 tournament before losing a rematch with Oregon, the eventual champion. Krystkowiak's third season saw the 2013–2014 Runnin' Utes reach their first postseason tournament under the coach. The addition of transfer point guard Delon Wright and an improved core of players led Utah to a 21-12 record, receiving an at-large bid to the NIT. The next year, he led his team to the sweet sixteen, their highest run in the tournament in years. In 2017–18, he led the Utes to their first NIT finals appearance in 44 years. The National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame nominated Krystkowiak for its Class of 2013.[15] On June 21, 2018 Krystkowiak will be enshrined into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 2018 in Troy, Michigan. Larry and his wife, Jan, have five children, Cam, Luc, Ben and twin girls Samantha and Finley.[8] He has seen his father only once in over 30 years, because of the issues in his early life.[6] Larry Krystkowiak's record as a head coach.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/172.png

He played 78 games for them in 1977–78, averaging 4.8 points, 1.5 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game.[1] In his second and third (and final) seasons he played with the Denver Nuggets and Indiana Pacers, respectively. After his playing days, Kuester began a basketball coaching career, volunteering as an assistant at the University of Richmond in 1980 to 1981.[4] From 1981 to 1983 he was an assistant to Rick Pitino at Boston University, before succeeding him in 1983 as the youngest head coach in NCAA Division I.[3][4][6] From 1985 to 1990 he was the head coach at George Washington University. His 1988–1989 Colonials team compiled a 1-27 record, one of the worst ever in NCAA history.[4] He continued his career on the sidelines in the NBA, joining the Boston Celtics in 1990 and serving as an assistant from 1995 to 1997,[4] and from 1997 to 2003 an assistant for the Philadelphia 76ers under head coach Larry Brown. In 2003–04, Kuester followed Brown to the Detroit Pistons where he also served as an assistant. In 2004–05 Kuester was an assistant with the New Jersey Nets,[3] and returned to the 76ers once more in 2005–06. In July 2006, Kuester was named as an assistant coach for the Orlando Magic.[7] In August 2007, Kuester was named to Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown's staff, replacing the departing Kenny Natt.[8] In July 2009, Kuester was hired as head coach of the Detroit Pistons, replacing Michael Curry.[9] On June 5, 2011, Kuester was fired from his position as head coach of the Detroit Pistons.[10] On June 29, 2011, Kuester was hired as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers under new head coach Mike Brown. Since his days in Cleveland, this marked the second time Kuester has worked as an assistant coach under Brown. On September 7, 2012, Kuester was named an advance scout for the Lakers.[11] Kuester and wife, Tricia, have a son, John III, and a daughter, Katelyn.[4] Katelyn (""Katie"") played basketball at St. Joseph's University.[12][13]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/173.png
174,John Kundla,"July 3, 1916","July 23, 2017","Minneapolis Central in Minneapolis, Minnesota",Minnesota,1949,1959,11,true,,"""[1]""",/coaches/kundljo99c.html,"John Albert Kundla (July 3, 1916 – July 23, 2017) was an American college and professional basketball coach. He was the first head coach for the Minneapolis Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and its predecessors, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and the National Basketball League (NBL), serving 12 seasons, from 1947 to 1959. His teams won six league championships, one in the NBL, one in the BAA, and four in the NBA. Kundla was the head basketball coach at the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul for one season in 1946–47, and at the University of Minnesota for ten seasons, from 1959 to 1968. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1995 and the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. Kundla was born in the mining town of Star Junction, Pennsylvania to parents from Jakubany, at that time Austria-Hungary, now Slovakia.[1][2] He moved to Minneapolis at age 5.[3] After attending and playing basketball for Minneapolis Central High School (which closed in 1982), Kundla attended the University of Minnesota and was a standout for the Minnesota Golden Gophers basketball the late 1930s.[4] Following graduation, he stayed on at the university as an assistant coach to Dave MacMillan. He then moved to the high school ranks as the head coach of DeLaSalle High School in Minneapolis, Minnesota. After two years there, the United States entered World War II, and Kundla joined the Navy, where he was assigned to LST units in both the European and Pacific theaters. After the war, he was hired to coach the College of St. Thomas in 1946.[3] Following the Minneapolis' College of St. Thomas Tommies' 1946–47 season, the new professional franchise in town, the Minneapolis Lakers of the National Basketball League extended an offer to Kundla to coach the team. Kundla turned the offer down, however, as he was not impressed with the professional ranks. Team representatives returned, and this time the offer had been upped to $6,000 (twice his St. Thomas salary) and Kundla took the job at age 31.[3][5] Kundla and the Lakers were immediately successful. A month into the 1947–48 season, future Hall of Fame center George Mikan became available when the Chicago American Gears, folded. Outhustling the rest of the NBL and the teams of the rival Basketball Association of America (BAA), the predecessor of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Lakers signed Mikan. Kundla then guided the George Mikan-led Lakers, which also included star Jim Pollard, to the 1948 NBL title. The Lakers defeated the Washington Capitals and Coach Red Auerbach in the BAA Finals 4 games to 2.[5][6] Moving to the BAA for the 1948–49 season, which became the NBA in 1949–50, Kundla's Lakers won five NBA titles in six years, with 1951 being the only gap in the team's run, a season in which Mikan broke his ankle at the end of the campaign, thus allowing the Rochester Royals to defeat the Lakers in the Western Conference championship series three games to one. The first team to repeat as league champions then became the first team to three-peat, with Mikan fully healed for the 1951–52, 1952–53, and 1953–54 seasons.[7] Kulda's Lakers rosters included Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame players Mikan, Pollard, Slater Martin, Vern Mikkelsen, Clyde Lovellette, Slick Leonard, Hot Rod Hundley and Elgin Baylor, as well as Arnie Ferrin, Walter Dukes, Dick Garmaker, Frank Selvy and future Pro Football Hall of Famer and Minnesota Vikings Coach Bud Grant.[8] Kundla briefly moved to the Lakers front office ahead of the 1957–58 season. Coached by Mikan, the Lakers' record was 9-30, when Mikan stepped down and Kundla immediately returned to the bench, going 10-23 as the team finished 19-53, recording one of the worst seasons in its history missing the NBA playoffs for the only time in Kudla's tenure.[9] Kundla then led the Lakers to a 33-39 record in his final season with an improved roster. Despite their losing record, Kundla led the 1958-1959 Lakers, with rookie Elgin Baylor, to series victories over the Detroit Pistons (2-1) and St. Louis Hawks (4-1) in the NBA Playoffs to reach the 1959 NBA Finals. The Lakers lost in the NBA Finals to Red Auerbach's Boston Celtics with Bill Russell and Bob Cousy in four games.[10][11] Overall, Kundla was 423-302 (.583) in eleven seasons as Coach of the Minneapolis Lakers, winning the BAA Championship in 1949 and NBA Championships in 1950, 1952, 1953 and 1954.[10] In 1959, knowing that the Lakers franchise was going to be moved to Los Angeles (after being purchased by Bob Short, the team moved in 1960) and despite having future Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor on the team, Kundla chose to stay in Minnesota and resigned from the Lakers position to coach his alma mater, the University of Minnesota.[5] While coaching he also taught physical education at the university. He was the first Gophers coach to give scholarships to African-American players, resulting in him receiving hate mail.[3] Kundla stayed with the Gophers for nine years before retiring from coaching after the 1967–68 season with a record of 110-105.[12] He retired from teaching in 1981.[3] In 1996, Kundla was voted as one of the 10 greatest coaches in the history of the NBA.[7] In 11 years of coaching in the BAA/NBA, he had a record of 423–302 in the regular season and 60–35 in the playoffs. Kundla's 1947–48 NBL championship season team went 43–17 during the regular season with 14 more wins in the post-season, but does not count under official NBA records. Kundla was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1995, after being lamented as ""all but forgotten"" in a 1992 USA Today column.[3] Kulda was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. In 1996, he was voted one of the top-10 coaches in league history for the ""N.B.A. at 50"" celebration.[3] After the Los Angeles Lakers won their 2002 championship, Kundla was awarded a championship ring along with other living Minneapolis Lakers players at a ceremony at the Staples Center.[3] Kundla met his wife, Marie, as undergraduates; the two raised six children. After resigning from the Lakers, he stayed close with Mikan and Vern Mikkelsen, often meeting his former players for breakfast.[3] Kundla is the grandfather of former Michigan State Spartans men's basketball player, Isaiah Dahlman, and former Wofford Terriers men's basketball player, Noah Dahlman, who was named the Southern Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 2009–10. His wife died in 2007; the following year he moved into the Main Street Lodge Assisted Living Home in Minneapolis and continued to watch and follow the NBA.[3][13][14] Kundla turned 100 in July 2016[15] and died on July 23, 2017, twenty days after his 101st birthday.[16]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/174.png
175,Bob Lanier,"September 10, 1948",,"Bennett in Buffalo, New York",St. Bonaventure,1995,1995,1,true,,"""[1]""",/coaches/laniebo01c.html,"Robert Jerry Lanier, Jr. (born September 10, 1948) is an American retired professional basketball player who played for the Detroit Pistons and Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Lanier was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992. In his 14 NBA seasons, Lanier averaged 20.1 points, 10.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.5 blocks, and 1.1 steals while shooting 51.4 percent from the field. He played in eight NBA All-Star Games, and was named Most Valuable Player of the 1974 game. He has had his #16 jersey retired by both the Pistons and the Bucks and his #31 jersey retired by St. Bonaventure University. Lanier is an NBA ambassador. Robert Jerry Lanier Jr. was born on September 10, 1948, in Buffalo, New York, the son of Robert Sr. and Nannette Lanier.[1] Growing up in Buffalo, Lanier initially was rejected in his basketball efforts. Trying out for his grammar school team, Lanier was told by a coach that his feet ( size 11 at age 11) were too large for him to be a successful athlete. Although he was 6-foot-5 by age 16, Lanier didn't make the varsity basketball squad in his sophomore year at Bennett High School under coach Nick Mogavero because he was deemed too clumsy.[1][2] In his junior year, he was encouraged to try out again by new coach Fred Schwepker, who had Lanier in Biology class. Lanier tried out again. Lanier averaged 21.5 points for Bennett High School and was named to the All-City team as a junior. In his senior year, he averaged 25.0 points and he earned All-Western New York State honors. Both years he led Bennett to Buffalo city titles.[1][3][2] After his successes under coach Schwepker, Lanier graduated in 1966.[4] Lanier was initially rejected by his first college choice, Buffalo's Canisius College, because of his grades. But, as he was recruited by more than 100 other schools, he then elected to attend St. Bonaventure University, in Allegany, New York, under Coach Larry Weise.[3] “There was recruiting competition, but the advantage I had, and what I sold was that his parents could come watch him play,’’ Said Coach Weise. “He picked St. Bonaventure. His parents were at every game.’’[5] Lanier was a three-time Converse All-America selection (1968–1970), playing for coach Weise at St. Bonaventure. In 1970, he led the St. Bonaventure to the NCAA Final Four. He injured his knee near the end of the regional championship game in a collision with Villanova's Chris Ford and did not participate in St. Bonaventure's National Semifinal loss to Jacksonville University with center Artis Gilmore. That year he was named Coach and Athlete Magazine player of the year, and the ECAC Player of the Year. As a 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) sophomore in the 1967–68 season, after having played on the freshman team the previous year per NCAA rules at the time, Lanier made an immediate national impact, as he led the St. Bonaventure (13–9 in the previous season) to an undefeated regular season (26–0) and a no. 3 final poll ranking. Lanier averaged 26.2 points and 15.6 rebounds.[6] Against Loyola Maryland, Lanier had 27 rebounds, leading St. Bonaventure to a 94–78 victory.[2] In the 23-team 1968 NCAA Tournament, Lanier led St. Bonaventure to a 102–93 victory over Boston College and coach Bob Cousy. The Bonies were then defeated 91–72 by North Carolina and coach Dean Smith in the East Regional Semifinal, ending their undefeated season.[6] Lanier had 32 points and 15 rebounds in the victory over Boston College and 23 points with 9 rebounds in the North Carolina loss. Lanier then fouled out, scoring 18 points with 13 rebounds in the third-place East Region game, a 92–75 loss to Columbia.[7] Lanier was named second-team All-American, behind Lew Alcindor at center.[8] In the 1968–69 season, St. Bonaventure finished 17–7 without any postseason invitations, after starting the season 3–5.[9] Against Seton Hall, Lanier scored 51 points, the single-game scoring record for St. Bonaventure.[2] Lanier, averaged 27.3 points and 15.6 rebounds in 24 games. Lanier was again named second-team All-American, behind Lew Alcindor at center.[8] During his junior year, Lanier was approached by representatives of the American Basketball Association's New York Nets, who reportedly offered him $1.2 million to leave school early and join the ABA. However, following his father's advice, Lanier chose to remain in school.[1] Lanier averaged 29.2 points and 16.0 rebounds as St. Bonaventure finished the 1969–70 regular season 25–1 (with the only loss at Villanova 64–62) and a no. 3 national ranking. In the 25-team 1970 NCAA Tournament, Lanier led St. Bonaventure to an 80–72 victory over Davidson College with 28 points and 15 rebounds; he had 24 points and 19 rebounds in an 80–68 victory over NC State, and 26 points and 14 rebounds in the 97–74 victory over Villanova, as St. Bonaventure to advanced to the Final Four.[10][11] However, Lanier injured his knee near the end of the regional championship game in a collision with Villanova's Chris Ford. It was severe enough that he could not play in the Final Four and eventually required surgery, the first of eight surgeries on Lanier's knees.[5][5][12] In the Final Four, the Bonnies lost to Jacksonville University with future Hall of Fame center Artis Gilmore. St. Bonaventure was whistled for 32 personal fouls and outscored 37–15 at the free-throw line, in the 91–83 loss. In the third-place game, the Bonnies lost to NM State to finish the season 25–3.[5][5] ""Every year at this time you start thinking about it and my players start thinking about it,"" reflected Coach Larry Weise at age 81. ""We have a reunion every three, four years and it’s the same with them. It was a magical moment in our lives, no question. In our hearts, we knew we were good enough to win the championship.""[5] ""I think I appreciate it even more than my (college) teammates,"" Lanier reflected on the Final Four in 1985, ""because I had a basis for comparison. It wasn't the money, or who got the 'numbers' like in the NBA. We weren't any big stars, it was a couple of guys from Buffalo and a guy from Troy all blending together.""[12] Lanier was named first-team All-American at center, alongside future Hall of Famers Dan Issel (Kentucky), Pete Maravich (LSU) and Calvin Murphy (Niagara), along with College Basketball Hall of Famer Rick Mount (Purdue).[8] Lanier graduated from St. Bonaventure with a degree in business administration.[2] Lanier holds St. Bonaventure records for scoring and rebounding, averaging 27.6 points and 15.7 rebounds, with 57% shooting in 75 career games.[13][14] Lanier was the number one overall pick by the National Basketball Association's Detroit Pistons in the 1970 NBA draft. He was also a territorial pick by the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association in the 1970 ABA Draft. The Nets had approached Lanier about turning professional after his junior year of college, but he declined because he felt St. Bonaventure could compete for a national championship.[15][16] Still recovering from knee surgery, Lanier signed with the Pistons, who eagerly presented him his NBA contract while he was still in the hospital recuperating from his knee surgery. Lanier reported to Pistons training camp limping, in significant pain, and overweight from his long period of inactivity following the surgery.[1] Lanier played while still recovering from surgery. He was named to the 1971 NBA All-Rookie Team, averaging 15.6 points and 8.1 rebounds, for the 45–37 Pistons, in 24 minutes per game under Coach Butch van Breda Kolff.[16] ""I wasn't healthy when I got to the league,"" Lanier reflected. ""I shouldn’t have played my first year. But there was so much pressure from them to play, I would have been much better off—and our team would have been much better served—if I had just sat out that year and worked on my knee. My knee was so sore every single day that it was ludicrous to be doing what I was doing.""[16] Lanier rehabilitated his knee with the help of Coach van Breda Kolff, who had Lanier stay at his beachfront house for 2½ weeks to run in the sand and strengthen his knee and legs.[16] Lanier became a star for Detroit, playing alongside teammate Dave Bing and averaging more than 21 points per game for each of the next eight seasons, with a high mark of 25.7 PPG in the 1971–72 season, and more than 11 rebounds per game in seven straight seasons. Lanier's latter years in Detroit were marred by recurring injuries, as he never played more than 64 games in any of his last four seasons as a Piston. Detroit was a franchise in constant transition. Lanier played under eight coaches in ten seasons: Butch van Breda Kolff (1970–1971), Terry Dischinger (1971), Earl Lloyd (1971–1972), Ray Scott (1972–1975), Herb Brown (1975–1977), Bob Kauffman (1977–1978), Dick Vitale (1978–1979) and Richie Adubato (1979–1980). Each coach was hired or fired mid-season.[17] Of his time in Detroit, Lanier said, ""I think '73–74 was our best team [52–30]. We had Dave [Bing], Stu Lantz, John Mengelt, Chris Ford, Don Adams, Curtis Rowe, George Trapp. But then for some reason, they traded six guys off that team before the following year. I just didn’t feel we ever had the leadership. I think we had [seven] head coaches in my 10 years there. That was a rough time because, at the end of every year, you'd be so despondent."" Lanier played in seven NBA All-Star games with the Pistons and was the MVP of the 1974 NBA All-Star Game.[18] In his ten seasons with the Pistons, Lanier averaged a double-double 22.7 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 2.0 blocks and 1.2 steals in 681 games for Detroit. Lanier is the Pistons' all-time leader in scoring average (22.7 ppg) and ranks second in total rebounds (8,063) and third in total points (15,488).[3][18] February 4, 1980 Lanier was traded by the Detroit Pistons to the Milwaukee Bucks for Kent Benson and a 1980 1st round draft pick (Larry Drew was later selected).[18] In Lanier's five seasons with the Bucks, they won the Midwest Division championship each year under Coach Don Nelson, with Lanier playing alongside teammates Marques Johnson, Sidney Moncrief, Quinn Buckner, Junior Bridgeman and Dave Cowens. Still highly effective, with aging knees, Lanier played a key role with the Bucks while averaging nearly 10 minutes less per game in his Milwaukee tenure that he had in Detroit (36.2 to 26.8).[18] Of going to Milwaukee, ""I wanted the trade."" Lanier said. ""I got to Milwaukee... and the people gave me a standing ovation and really made me feel welcome. It was the start of a positive change. I just wish I had played with that kind of talent around me when I was young. But if I had had Marques [Johnson] and Sidney [Moncrief] and all of them around me? Damn.""[16] Lanier officially retired from the Milwaukee Bucks September 24, 1984.[18] In 278 games with the Bucks, Lanier averaged 26 minutes and 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.0 steals. He played in the 1982 All-Star Game with Milwaukee.[18] For his fourteen-season career, Lanier played in 959 games, averaging 20.1 points, 10.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.5 blocks and 1.1 steals. He scored 19,248 total points and had 9,698 total rebounds.[18] In 67 career playoff games, Lanier averaged 18.6 points, 9.7 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.5 blocks. Lanier played in eight NBA All-Star Games.[3][18] ""Bob probably wasn't as good a total player as he could have been because of the knee injury,"" said Hall of Famer Willis Reed, acknowledging, ""He probably was one of the best all-around big men ever to play the game of basketball.""[12] In the 1994–95 season, Lanier was hired as an assistant coach under his former coach Don Nelson with the Golden State Warriors. Lanier was named the interim head coach on February 13, 1995, after Nelson resigned. He compiled a 12–25 win-loss record in 37 games, as the Warriors finished 26–56 overall.[19][20] Lanier currently owns and operates Bob Lanier Enterprises, Inc., a promotional marketing company and is a member of the Proforma network.[21] From 2005 to the present day, Lanier has been the NBA Cares Global Ambassador. Lanier routinely works with youth-serving programs that support education, youth, and family development, and health-related causes.[22] At the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, visitors are able to compare the size of their foot to that of Lanier's. The largest shoe ever created by shoe company Allen Edmonds was a size 22 for Lanier. Lanier was a spokesperson and chairman of the NBA's ""Stay In School"" program (later renamed Read to Achieve) from 1989 to 1994.[3] According to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Lanier would smoke cigarettes during halftime breaks. Abdul-Jabbar would try to take advantage of this by forcing Lanier to run more during the second half.[23] In the movie Airplane!, Abdul-Jabbar also references Lanier when he says to little Joey: ""Tell your old man to drag Walton and Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes."" In March 2018, St. Bonaventure won its first game in the NCAA Tournament since 1970, defeating UCLA. Coach Mark Schmidt said, ""It can't get better. Our guys just fought, we persevered. ... In 1970, you know, Bob Lanier got hurt, and didn't have a chance to play UCLA and ... this is for him.""[24] “When I got the job here 11 years ago, we hear the stories about 1970,” Schmidt said. “And everybody talks about if Lanier was healthy, they would have taken on UCLA. This victory is for those guys.”[25]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/175.png
176,Joe Lapchick,"April 12, 1900","August 10, 1970",,,1948,1956,9,true,,"""[2]""",/coaches/lapchjo99c.html,"Joseph Bohomiel Lapchick (April 12, 1900 – August 10, 1970) was an American professional basketball player, mostly known for playing with the Original Celtics in the 1920s and 1930s. He is commonly regarded as the best center of his era, overshadowed (if anything) in his later years only by Tarzan Cooper. After ending his playing career in 1937, Lapchick became head coach at St. John's University, a position he held until 1947, when he took over the New York Knicks in the NBA. Lapchick coached the Knicks until 1957, leading them to three consecutive NBA Finals appearances (1951–53). He returned to St. John's, coaching them until 1965. From star player to successful coach to popular author to respected dignitary, Joe Lapchick played a variety of roles in his more than 50 years in the game of basketball. He was an eminently influential figure who helped nurture the sport from its crude beginnings into its modern form. Born in Yonkers, New York to Czech immigrants, Lapchick as a boy helped his struggling family make ends meet by scrounging for coal near railroad tracks. At age 12 the youngster started playing basketball around his neighborhood, wearing a uniform his mother had made for him. Like many youngsters of the era, he stopped going to school after the eighth grade. While working as a caddie and in a factory, the 15-year-old found he could make $5 to $10 per night playing for local basketball teams. At age 19 he was suiting up for four different touring teams, such as the Holyoke Reds, Brooklyn Visitations, and Troy Trojans, and pocketing up to $100 per game. Basketball became his life. Lapchick was rangy at 6-foot-5, making him a valuable commodity at a time when a jump ball was held after every basket. ""I played one manager against the other,"" he said years later. ""I bargained with the managers for every game. When there was a clash of dates, I took the best offer."" In 1923 he joined the fabled Original Celtics (a team that was the second incarnation of the New York Celtics, which had disbanded during World War I). At first the team eschewed league play, choosing instead to barnstorm throughout the Northeast and wow crowds with its razzle-dazzle style of play. Conditions were spartan. When a large cut on Lapchick's wrist became infected with uniform dye, a teammate rubbed off the scab with a towel and doused the wound with whiskey. Luckily for Lapchick, the treatment worked. The Celtics joined the American Basketball League in 1926 and won two straight titles. So dominant were Lapchick, Nat Holman, and the rest of the Celtics that the league insisted the team disband. It did, in 1928. Lapchick and two other former Celtics then joined the Cleveland Rosenblums, a team owned by a department store magnate who had named the team after himself. With Lapchick starring at the pivot, the ""Rosenblum Celtics"" won two straight ABL titles. The Great Depression forced an end to the ABL in 1931. Still a young man, Lapchick re-formed the Celtics with Dutch Dehnert, Davey Banks, Nat Hickey, Johnny Beckman, Carl Husta and him. They hit the road for five years, with Lapchick handling driving duties, and Kate Smith singing ""God Bless America"" at games. In 1936 Lapchick landed the coaching job at St. John's University, New York City. In 11 seasons he steered the Redmen to a 180-55 record and two consecutive National Invitation Tournament titles, in 1943 and 1944. Overwhelmed by stress, Lapchick fainted during the second half of the 1944 final game. In 1947 he passed up a then-astronomical offer of $12,000 per year to stay at St. John's, opting instead to accept a job as coach of the New York Knickerbockers of the fledgling Basketball Association of America. Landing Lapchick was a big boost to the league, which was in only its second year of operation. He signed Nathaniel ""Sweetwater"" Clifton to the Knicks, one of the league's first African-American players.[1] As a star center with the Original Celtics and other barnstorming teams, a college coach at St. John's, an NBA coach with the New York Knicks, and an ambassador of the sport, Lapchick cast a broad shadow across the game and its history. Though a slick player and an admired coach, Lapchick was perhaps best known for his obsessive worrying and anxiety during games. He lived every second of every game as though it were the last tick of the clock. Stress related health problems ended his professional coaching career and caused an occasional on-court fainting spell and even a few heart attacks. Lapchick was respected for his motivational coaching style, which focused less on mechanics than on eliciting peak performances from his players. Stressing a freewheeling offensive approach and smooth ballhandling, Lapchick built winners at both the college and pro levels. As a player, Lapchick had sharp passing and shooting skills that made him one of the first great pro centers and that helped his teams win several championships. Continuing to emphasize his themes of personal achievement and responsibility, Lapchick led the Knicks to eight straight winning seasons and eight trips to the playoffs, including three straight NBA Finals from 1951 to 1953. The 1953–54 Knicks were more than just a team of talented players; eight of them went on to coach pro or college teams, a tribute to Lapchick's leadership. Though a great motivator, Lapchick was a wild man on the sidelines, stomping on his coat, smashing chairs, and tossing various objects into the air. Stress-related health problems forced him to quit near the end of the 1955–56 season. He left the Knicks with a 326-247 NBA coaching record. Lapchick rested for only a month before returning to St. John's, where in nine more seasons he led the Redmen to two more NIT crowns, giving them a record four titles. Lapchick wasn't just his players’ basketball coach; he monitored their academic performance as well. The school's mandatory-retirement rules forced Lapchick, a two-time college Coach of the Year, to step down after the 1964–65 season at age 65. He had several heart attacks that year. The season ended with the Redmen upsetting Villanova, 55-51, in an emotional NIT Championship Game. Describing his final season at St. John's, Lapchick told the Washington, D.C.–based Evening Star: ""I used to double up with chest pains. Sometimes I couldn’t even talk to the team during halftime."" Lapchick turned to writing. In 1968 he wrote 50 Years of Basketball, a book that was both a compilation of stories from Lapchick's early days as a player and an explanation of his coaching philosophy. As one of basketball's most prominent elder statesmen, Lapchick also stayed active as a spokesman for the sport. He died of a heart attack in Monticello, New York, in 1970 at age 70. Lapchick married Elizabeth Sarubbi in 1931; they had one daughter and had two sons. Barbara Lapchick was one of the original Ford models and graduated from Barnard College. Dr. Richard Lapchick is a human rights activist working for racial equality, an internationally recognized expert on sports issues, a scholar and an author. Lapchick is the Endowed Chair and Director of the DeVos Sport Business Management Program at the College of Business Administration, University of Central Florida. He is also President/CEO of the National Consortium for Academics and Sport (NCAS), a school outreach program which focuses on teaching youth how to improve race relations, and develop conflict resolution skills.[2] Joseph Lapchick graduated from the USMA and took a commission in the USAF. He earned a Ph D at Harvard.

In addition to his coaching at the professional level, Layden coached at Adelphi Suffolk College and is also a former head coach and player of his alma mater Niagara University's basketball team. Layden coached Niagara to its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1970, with the help of Calvin Murphy. In 1976 he was hired to be an assistant coach with the NBA's Atlanta Hawks joining former Niagara teammate Hubie Brown. In 1979 he was hired to be the general manager of the then New Orleans Jazz, and became the head coach of the Jazz (now in Salt Lake City) in 1981, replacing Tom Nissalke. He coached the Jazz for the next seven-and-a-half years. He was instrumental in drafting and signing franchise mainstays John Stockton and Karl Malone to the club. He retired from coaching during the 1988–1989 NBA season, with the team at an 11–6 record and leading the Midwest Division, citing ""pressure"" and a general burnout from coaching.[2] moving into the team's front office and was replaced as coach by his assistant, Jerry Sloan. ""I had a guy come up to me and say 'hit me, hit me', I'm a lawyer'. I think America takes all sports too seriously"" Layden said after resigning.[2] ""Sometimes in the NBA, you feel like a dog. You age seven years in one. The pressure in the NBA is intense. It's time to have my time.""[2] In his final game, Layden was ejected by referee Earl Strom after getting into a shouting match with Washington Bullets guard Darrell Walker.[2] In 1984, Layden was awarded the NBA's Coach of the Year. That same season, he also won the NBA's Executive of the Year and the NBA's J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Awards. (He and Joe O'Toole are the only non-players in NBA history to win the award.) Layden joined the Utah Eagles of the Continental Basketball Association in October 2006 as an honorary assistant coach.[3] Layden was the head coach of the Utah Starzz Women's National Basketball Association team from 1998 through 1999 before quitting so he could ""enjoy life.""[4] Layden would a few months later quit as team president of the Jazz for the very same reasons. Layden was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Basketball and Professional Sports Categories with the Class of 1990. Layden retired from coaching the Jazz in 1989 to serve full-time as the franchise team president and general manager, hiring former NBA player and then Jazz assistant Jerry Sloan as the new head coach. During this time, Layden participated with Marv Albert in a video published by Sports Illustrated called Dazzling Dunks and Basketball Bloopers, as well as a sequel to that a year later. Layden once served briefly as a consultant for the New York Knicks, where his son Scott Layden served as general manager for a time. He continues to live with his wife, Barbara, in Salt Lake City. Layden during his coaching days was known for his lighthearted approach to the game as well as to himself. Often he mocked his weight and looks and was known for giving one-liners to the media before and after games such as ""I don't jog because I want to be sick when I die"" and ""I once got on a scale to have my fortune read and it said 'come back again alone.'"".[5] Layden was once over 300 pounds but slimmed down in the Summer of 1986, losing over 85 pounds for health reasons.[5] Even after he lost weight he still made himself the butt of jokes, especially about weight and food.[5] He was once fined $1,000 during a game in 1986 for making a satirical wave goodbye and exit after getting ejected.[5] Once in a road game against the Denver Nuggets, there was a halftime contest where a young fan won a halftime shooting contest. Layden pulled the kid aside and jokingly asked him if he was interested in helping out the Jazz, who were down by 25 points at the time. Layden then tried sneaking him onto the court with four other Jazz players and got the fan on the court before the referees realized what was going on and stopped play.[5] In a 1985 game against the Los Angeles Lakers, with the Jazz down by a sizable deficit, Layden left the game while it was still ongoing and returned to the team's hotel across from The Forum, visiting the sandwich shop to order a sandwich and chili.[6] During the 1987 playoff series against the Golden State Warriors, Layden arrived to the arena in full Groucho Marx nose, glasses, and mustache getup and did a comedy bit with Warriors coach George Karl to try and make things more lighthearted after the previous game featured tension-filled moments and fighting amongst players.[5] It was because of his personality that he was often used as a presenter for displaying the lighthearted moments in the NBA as well as in sports, hosting specials for video and on television, including two NBA blooper tapes that he co-hosted along with Marv Albert.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/177.png

In his final season as a player, he also coached the Zephyrs. The next year, the team moved to Baltimore; Leonard coached them for one more year. Five years after coaching the Bullets, Leonard became the coach of the American Basketball Association's Indiana Pacers, a position he held for nearly 12 years – the last four after the franchise moved to the NBA. For a time, he also served as general manager. Leonard led the Pacers to three ABA championships before the ABA–NBA merger in June 1976. However, the Pacers were nearly gutted in order to meet the financial burdens imposed by the merger, and he was never able to put together a winning team during the Pacers' first four years as an NBA team. Leonard returned to the Pacers in 1985 as a color commentator, first for television with Jerry Baker, then on radio, where he remains alongside Mark Boyle on WFNI 1070 AM.

He was the first black player to have played a game in the National Basketball Association.[2] An All-American player at West Virginia State University, Lloyd helped lead the Syracuse Nationals to the NBA Championship in 1955. Lloyd was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2003. Earl Lloyd was born in Alexandria, Virginia on April 3, 1928 to Theodore Lloyd, Sr. and Daisy Lloyd. His father worked in the coal industry and his mother was a stay-at-home mom. Being a high school standout, Lloyd was named to the All-South Atlantic Conference three times and the All-State Virginia Interscholastic Conference twice. Lloyd did attend a segregated school, but gives gratitude to his family and educators for helping him through the tough times and his success after school. Lloyd was a 1946 graduate of Parker-Grey High School, where he played for Coach Louis Randolph Johnson. He received a scholarship to play basketball at West Virginia State University, home of the Yellow Jackets. In school he was nicknamed ""Moon Fixer"" because of his size and was known as a defensive specialist.[3][4] Lloyd led West Virginia State to two Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) Conference and Tournament Championships in 1948 and 1949. He was named All-Conference three times (1948–50) and was All-American twice, as named by the Pittsburgh Courier (1949–50). As a senior, he averaged 14 points and 8 rebounds per game, while leading West Virginia State to a second-place finish in the CIAA Conference and Tournament Championship. In 1947–48, West Virginia State was the only undefeated team in the United States, with a 30-0 record.[5] Lloyd graduated from WVSU with his B.S. degree in physical education in 1950.[4] Lloyd was drafted in the 9th round with pick #100 by the Washington Capitols in the 1950 NBA draft. Nicknamed ""The Big Cat"", Lloyd was one of three black players to enter the NBA at the same time. It was because of the order in which the team's season openers fell that Lloyd was the first to actually play in a game in the NBA, scoring six points on Halloween night.[6] The date was October 31, 1950, one day ahead of Chuck Cooper of the Boston Celtics and four days before Nat ""Sweetwater"" Clifton of the New York Knicks. Lloyd played in over 560 games in nine seasons, the 6-foot-5, 225-pound forward averaged played in only seven games for the Washington Capitols before the team folded on January 9, 1951. He was then drafted into the U.S. Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. While fulfilling his military duty, the Syracuse Nationals picked him up on waivers. Lloyd served time fighting in the Korean War before coming back to basketball in 1952. In the 1953–54 season, Lloyd led the NBA in both personal fouls and disqualifications.[7] In 1954-1955, Lloyd averaged career highs of 10.2 points and 7.7 rebounds for Syracuse, which beat the Fort Wayne Pistons 4-3 to win the 1955 NBA Championship. Lloyd and Jim Tucker became the first African-Americans to play on an NBA championship team. Lloys spent six seasons with Syracuse and two with the Detroit Pistons before retiring in 1961.[8] Regarding the racism black players faced in the early years of the NBA, Lloyd recalled being refused service multiple times and an incident where a fan in Indiana spit on him. However, Lloyd persevered and said that these instances only pushed him and made him play harder.[3] Saying he didn't encounter racial animosity from teammates or opposing players, Lloyd said of fans' antics, “My philosophy was: If they weren’t calling you names, you weren’t doing nothing. If they’re calling you names, you were hurting them.”[9] ""In 1950, basketball was like a babe in the woods; it didn't enjoy the notoriety that baseball enjoyed,"" Lloyd once said. ""I don't think my situation was anything like Jackie Robinson's-a guy who played in a hostile environment, where some of his teammates didn't want him around. In basketball, folks were used to seeing integrated college teams. There was a different mentality.""[10] “He’s an unsung star. Anybody can score. Lloyd was an excellent defensive player. That was No. 1 on my roster.” said his Syracuse Coach Al Cervi.[9] In his NBA career with the Washington Capitols (1950-1951), Syracuse Nationals (1952-1958) and Detroit Pistons (1958-1960), Earl averaged 8.4 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 560 games over nine seasons.[11] According to Detroit News sportswriter Jerry Green, in 1965 Detroit Pistons General Manager Don Wattrick wanted to hire Lloyd as the team's head coach.[citation needed] Dave DeBusschere was instead named Pistons player–coach. Lloyd was the first African-American assistant coach and was named head coach for the 1971-72 season, making him the third African-American head coach, after John McLendon and Bill Russell.[6] After starting the 1972-73 season off with a 2-5 record, Lloyd was fired. He had an overall record of 22-55 with the Pistons.[12] Lloyd worked for the Pistons as a scout for five seasons. Lloyd is credited with helping draft Bailey Howell and discovering Willis Reed, Earl Monroe, Ray Scott and Wally Jones.[6][13][4] After his basketball career, Lloyd worked during the 1970s and 1980s as a job placement administrator for the Detroit public school system. During this time, Lloyd also ran programs for underprivileged children teaching job skills. Lloyd served as Community Relations Director for the Bing Group, a Detroit manufacturing company in the 1990s. Approached by a young African-American player who said he was indebted to Lloyd for opening the doors for future generations of black players, Lloyd replied that he owed him absolutely nothing.[14] “You cannot understand what an honor this is,” Lloyd said in 2007 about the court at T. C. Williams High School being named in his honor. “There’s no better honor than being validated by people who know you best. I will always, always treasure this.”[15] Lloyd and his wife, Charlita, have three sons and four grandchildren. Lloyd resided in Fairfield Glade, Tennessee, just outside Crossville, Tennessee, until his death on February 26, 2015.[16][17][18]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/183.png

In his first season at the helm of the NC State program, Lowe became just the third Wolfpack coach, after Everett Case and Press Maravich, to win 20 games and defeat the other three North Carolina institutions in the ACC (Duke, North Carolina and Wake Forest). He is one of only four NC State coaches to have coached in the ACC Championship game in their first year. In spite of the early success, Lowe failed to lead NC State to the NCAA tournament, and his teams only made two appearances in the NIT. He had an overall winning record (86–78) after five years but only a 25–55 conference record. Lowe resigned as head coach of NC State, accepting a buyout of the last two years of his contract, on March 15, 2011.[2] Later that year, he joined the Utah Jazz as an assistant. At the beginning of the 2014–15 season, Lowe rejoined the Minnesota Timberwolves as an assistant for the next two years, being fired at the end of the 2015–16 season.[3] On July 5, 2016, the Washington Wizards announced that Lowe had been hired as an assistant coach.[4] Lowe was hired by the Detroit Pistons beginning the 2018-19 season.

He serves as the player development coach of the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played basketball and tennis at the University of Maryland, College Park and was an All-American in both. Lucas attended the University of Maryland where he was an All-American in basketball. Lucas was a Second-team All-American for the Terrapins team in 1973-74, along with his teammates Len Elmore and Tom McMillen. The Terrapins had a record of 23-5 in the regular season, and 9-3 in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). However, they lost during the ACC Tournament, and they could not go to the NCAA Tournament. Elmore and McMillan graduated in 1974, but in the following 1974-75 season, Lucas was a First-team All-American. The Terrapins recorded a 24-5 regular season record, 10-2 in the ACC, and they won the ACC regular season crown. However, they lost to NC State in the semifinals of the ACC tournament. The NCAA tournament, however, had been expanded to include 32 teams. Also, for the first time, more than one team per conference was allowed into the tournament. Maryland gained entry and advanced to the Elite Eight before losing to Louisville. In the 1975-76 season, Lucas was a First-team All-American once again. The Terrapins recorded a 22-6 regular season record, 7-5 in the ACC, but they lost out in the ACC Tournament and did not make the NCAA Tournament. Then, following this senior season, Lucas was the first overall pick of the 1976 NBA draft, selected by the Houston Rockets. He was also drafted by the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association.[1] Lucas played for the US national team in the 1974 FIBA World Championship, winning the bronze medal.[2] Lucas played in the NBA for fourteen years and was a member of the 1986 Houston Rockets team that made it to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics. However, the following off-season, Lucas's basketball career took a turn for the worse when longstanding problems with illegal drugs became public. Several of his Rockets teammates, including Mitchell Wiggins and Lewis Lloyd, were banished from the NBA due to positive tests for cocaine usage. Lucas, who was also a cocaine user (and an alcoholic), submitted voluntarily to anti-drug and anti-alcohol treatment in order to stay in the league. After failing two tests in the 1985-86 season, the Rockets waived him in March, which meant he missed out on the run the Rockets had all the way to the NBA Finals. Lucas was finally given another chance in January 1987 when he was signed to a ten-day contract by the Milwaukee Bucks that led to a full contract for the rest of the season.[3] Lucas played four more years in the NBA, averaging at age 33 a career-high 17.5 points in 1986–87, before settling into a reserve role the next three years. After successfully undergoing drug rehabilitation and starting programs of his own to help other athletes rehabilitate, Lucas returned to the NBA as a coach, eventually becoming a head coach. Lucas runs a wellness and aftercare substance-abuse recovery program for athletes.[4] He has coached the San Antonio Spurs, Philadelphia 76ers and Cleveland Cavaliers, each for less than two seasons, compiling a 174–258 overall coaching record. His most successful stint was with the Spurs. In 1992–93, he took over from Jerry Tarkanian (9-11) and went 39–22 the rest of the season, and reached the Western Conference semi-finals. The next year the Spurs finished 55–27 but lost in the first round of playoffs. Prior to accepting the head coaching position for the Cavs, he was assistant coach for the Denver Nuggets for three seasons. Lucas worked with Indiana Pacers guard T. J. Ford in Houston after the guard sustained a neck injury from a hard foul from Atlanta's Al Horford.[5] Lucas was hired for the 2009–10 NBA season as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers under head coach Mike Dunleavy. Lucas began working with former NFL first round pick JaMarcus Russell in 2010 as a life coach, but ceased this role in April 2011.[6] In July 2016, Lucas joined the Houston Rockets as a player development coach.[7] Lucas was not only a standout basketball player, but also a standout tennis player. An All-American in the sport while at Maryland, he won ACC number one singles championship twice in 1974 and 1976, before being named the McKelvin Award winner as the conference's top all-around athlete. Lucas competed in two Grand Prix tennis tournaments in 1973, another in 1979, and a challenger event in 1979. His best result was reaching the semi-finals of the challenger in Raleigh, North Carolina, partnering Fred McNair. He won one other tour match, by default in doubles in 1973 in Merion, Pennsylvania while partnering Vic Seixas. He lost all four of the singles first round matches which he contested, and in straight sets.[8] His best singles result was a 4-6, 4-6 loss to John Austin. Lucas's career high ranking was 579th, in singles in December 1979.[9] (Doubles computer rankings were not officially kept until the early 1980s.) Lucas also played World Team Tennis with the San Francisco Golden Gaters in 1976, and the New Orleans Sun Belt Nets in 1978. He and Renée Richards had success teaming up as the Nets' regular mixed-doubles team in 1978. The 6'1"" Richards was delighted to have a male partner who was taller than she was.[10] In 2005, Lucas was the head coach of the Houston Wranglers, which featured Steffi Graf and Mardy Fish.

He also served as the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers. A former point guard, Lue played college basketball for the Nebraska Cornhuskers before being selected by the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 1998 NBA draft with the 23rd overall pick. He was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers shortly thereafter. As a member of the Lakers, Lue won two NBA championships in his first three seasons. After his playing career ended in 2009, Lue became Director of Basketball Development for the Boston Celtics.[1] In 2014, he was hired by the Cavaliers as associate head coach. Lue was promoted to head coach during the 2015–2016 season, replacing the fired David Blatt.[2] That same season, Lue coached the Cavaliers to their first-ever NBA championship and became one of the few rookie coaches in the NBA to ever lead his team to a title. Lue coached the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals in the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons; in both seasons, the Cavs were defeated by the Golden State Warriors. Lue was terminated by Cleveland in October 2018. Lue graduated from Raytown Senior High School in Raytown, Missouri.[3] He later attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, where he played basketball and studied sociology. Lue was a key member of the 1995-96 team that won the NIT, defeating St. Joseph's in the finals.[4] He finished his Cornhuskers career ranked third all-time in assists (432), fourth in three-pointers made (145) and attempted (407), fifth in steals (154) and seventh in scoring (1,577). Lue led Nebraska in assists in each of his three seasons and finished his career tied with Dave Hoppen for most games with 30 or more points (7). He declared for the NBA draft after his junior season. Lue opted for early entry into the 1998 NBA draft. He was selected 23rd overall by the Denver Nuggets but was traded on draft night to the Los Angeles Lakers with Tony Battie in exchange for Nick Van Exel. His first three years with the Lakers were disappointing. His playing time was limited and he suffered from injuries in 2000. But Lue excelled in the 2001 playoffs. Due to his quickness, he was specifically used to guard Allen Iverson during Game 1 of the Finals. In the off-season of 2001, Lue signed with the Washington Wizards, where he got considerably more playing time and subsequently became a better point guard. He played with the Orlando Magic in 2003–04 and had a lot of minutes alongside Tracy McGrady, but the team had the worst record in the NBA that season: 21–61. After the season concluded, Lue, McGrady, Juwan Howard, and Reece Gaines were traded to the Houston Rockets for Steve Francis, Cuttino Mobley and Kelvin Cato. In Houston, Lue saw a notable decrease in playing time due to the overabundance of point guards on the Rockets' roster, and was subsequently traded mid-season to the Atlanta Hawks for Jon Barry. Lue starred in Atlanta, although again his team had the worst record in the NBA and their worst record in franchise history: 13–69. On February 16, 2008, Lue was acquired by the Sacramento Kings in a trade with the Hawks. He was waived by the Kings on February 28, 2008. After clearing waivers, Lue signed a contract with the Dallas Mavericks on March 4.[5] On July 17, 2008, Lue was signed by the Milwaukee Bucks.[6] On February 5, 2009, Lue was traded back to the Magic in exchange for Keith Bogans and cash considerations.[7] In his final year as an NBA player, the Dwight Howard-led Magic advanced to the 2009 Finals but lost to Lue's former team, the Los Angeles Lakers. On October 23, 2009, the Boston Celtics named Lue director of basketball development.[1] In July 2013, he joined the Los Angeles Clippers' coaching staff.[8] On June 23, 2014, Lue joined the Cleveland Cavaliers as associate head coach, becoming the highest-paid assistant coach in the NBA. Lue had been a top candidate for the Cavs' head coaching job, which eventually went to David Blatt.[9] On January 22, 2016, Lue was named head coach of the Cavaliers immediately following the mid-season firing of Blatt.[10] He was signed to a three-year contract.[2] Lue coached the Cavs to an NBA championship that spring. In May, the Cavaliers defeated the Toronto Raptors in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, continuing their unbeaten streak in the 2016 playoffs and making Lue the first coach in NBA history to win his first 10 postseason games.[11] Eight days later, Lue led the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, becoming one of the few coaches to reach the Finals after becoming head coach in midseason. On June 19, 2016, the Cavaliers won their first-ever NBA Championship. Lue became the second rookie head coach in two years to win the title, the third head coach (along with Paul Westhead in 1979–80 and Pat Riley in 1981–82) to win a championship after becoming head coach in midseason, and the 14th person to have won an NBA championship as a head coach and as a player.[12][13] In the 2016–17 NBA season, Lue coached the Cavaliers to a 51–31 record. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers went 12–1 heading into the 2017 NBA Finals before losing to the Golden State Warriors in five games. On March 19, 2018, Lue announced that he would take a leave of absence from coaching the Cavaliers, citing recurrent chest pain.[14] Lue returned to coach before the regular season ended and helped the Cavaliers reach the 2018 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Warriors in four games. Lue's coaching style in Cleveland relied on flexibility and LeBron James's consistency; he shuffled players around James to adjust to matchups. In 2016, his Finals team followed the Warriors' own blueprint to beat them. Lue's style was described as undisciplined and unprepared in the regular season, but in the playoffs, he has been praised for his ability to ""think several moves ahead and create matchup advantages"".[15] At the 2016 ESPY Awards, Lue was named Best Coach/Manager and the Cavs were named Best Team. On October 28, 2018, the Cavaliers fired Lue after a 0–6 start of the season.[16] Afterwards, Lue worked in an informal role with head coach Doc Rivers of the Los Angeles Clippers.[17] Prior to the 2019–20 season, Lue was named the lead assistant coach on Rivers' staff.[18] As player: As coach: Lue is a first cousin once removed of NBA small forward Jayson Tatum. As a native of St. Louis, Tatum grew up within two hours of Lue's hometown of Mexico, Missouri and often attended his family barbecues.[19]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/191.png

He then graduated from Loyola University Maryland in 1994 with a degree in history and played on the Loyola Greyhounds men's basketball team from 1989 to 1993.[2] He appeared in 107 games and started 39 of them as a point guard.[3] During his four seasons with the Greyhounds, Malone totaled 370 points, 279 assists and 79 steals in 18.5 minutes per game.[4] While completing his degree at Loyola, Malone was an assistant high school basketball coach at Friends School of Baltimore.[5] After graduating from Loyola, Malone joined Oakland University as an assistant coach for Golden Grizzlies men's basketball under coach Greg Kampe.[5] Malone was about to start training to join the Michigan State Police before getting a job offer from Providence College coach Pete Gillen.[6] Malone was an assistant coach for Providence Friars men's basketball from 1995 to 1998. In the 1998–99 season, Malone was director of men's basketball administration at the University of Virginia.[5] He later moved up to the NBA in 2001 as a coaching associate with the New York Knicks who worked with players, coaching staff, personnel and the video coordinator and edited scouting reports. The Knicks promoted Malone to assistant coach in 2003.[7] Malone later served as an assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2005 to 2010. With Cleveland, Malone helped coach the Cavaliers to five consecutive playoff appearances, including the 2007 NBA Finals, and a franchise-record, league-best 66–16 season in the 2008–09 season.[7] Malone was an assistant coach with the New Orleans Hornets in the 2010–11 season. Allowing a league-best 8.7 fewer points per game than last season, the Hornets had the most improved defense of the season with Malone as assistant and made the 2011 Playoffs.[7] The Golden State Warriors hired Malone in the summer of 2011 as an assistant coach under Mark Jackson.[6] In the 2012–13 season, the Warriors improved from a 23–43 record to finish 47–35 and earn the team's first playoff berth since 2007.[8] As the sixth seed in the 2013 NBA Playoffs, the Warriors upset the third-seed Denver Nuggets in the first round and lost to the eventual Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs in six games the next round.[7] Malone was reportedly the highest-paid NBA assistant coach in the 2011–12 season.[6] In 2012, Malone was named the best assistant coach by the NBA general managers. Several Warriors, including Draymond Green and Stephen Curry have credited Malone as being a huge part of the team's success after his departure.[9] On June 3, 2013, Malone was hired by majority owner Vivek Ranadivé as the new head coach of the Sacramento Kings.[10] With the hiring, Malone and his father became the second father-son duo in NBA history, after Bill Musselman and Eric Musselman, to head coach an NBA team.[11] On December 15, 2014, he was fired by the Kings after starting the 2014–15 season with an 11–13 win-loss record.[12] On June 15, 2015, he was named the new head coach of the Denver Nuggets.[13] On December 24, 2019, the Denver Nuggets announced that they had agreed to a contract extension with Malone.[14] In January 2020, Malone joined the Serbian national team coaching staff as a consultant for the Olympic Qualifying Tournament.[15][16][17] Malone and his wife have two daughters together.[18]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/197.png

He served as the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers and general manager of the Detroit Pistons and Minnesota Timberwolves. As general manager of the Pistons, McCloskey assembled the team that would become known as the ""Bad Boys"" that won NBA championships in 1989 and 1990.[1] McCloskey was born in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania on September 19, 1925 to Buelah and Eddie McCloskey. After high school, he attended the University of Pittsburgh, where he played football. He left school to serve in World War II as a lieutenant commanding a landing ship for the Marines. After the war, McCloskey attended the University of Pennsylvania where he played three varsity sports.[1] McCloskey played one game for the Philadelphia Warriors of the NBA during the 1953 season, scoring 6 points in that game. McCloskey also spent time in Eastern Professional Basketball League, including with the Sunbury Mercuries. He served as head coach of the University of Pennsylvania from 1956 to 1966, and of Wake Forest from 1966 to 1972. Following that, he served as the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers from 1972 through 1974, earning a 48-116 win/loss record. He followed this stint as an assistant coach to Jerry West and the Los Angeles Lakers. When West became general manager in 1979, McCloskey felt he had earned the right to become head coach, but Jack McKinney was hired instead. In 1979, he became general manager of the Detroit Pistons. During the next 13 years, ""Trader Jack"", as he was known, made over 30 trades, constantly upgrading his team to become a true challenger to the Boston Celtics, one of the dominant teams in the NBA's Eastern Conference. His best-known moves were drafting future Hall-Of-Famer Joe Dumars outside the lottery and rebounding champ Dennis Rodman in the second round of the NBA Draft, trading three players for future all-star center and dominant rebounder Bill Laimbeer and trading superstar Adrian Dantley for Mark Aguirre during the 1988–89 season, a move that helped the Pistons win the NBA championship in 1989 and 1990.[1] After the Chicago Bulls swept an injury-riddled Piston team in the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals, ""Trader Jack"" made his last moves. He acquired Darrell Walker, Brad Sellers, and Orlando Woolridge, and let go of Vinnie Johnson and James Edwards to try to make the team younger. He drafted Doug Overton in the second round that year (the Pistons had traded their first-round pick away), who did not even play the following season. The Pistons struggled with their chemistry, as key subs like John Salley did not improve their performance, yet they won 48 games. They lost in five games to the New York Knicks in the first round, and McCloskey left the team. He later served in the front offices of the Minnesota Timberwolves (1992–1995), and the Toronto Raptors (2004), the latter on an interim basis. On March 29, 2008, McCloskey had his name honored in Detroit, with banner raised at The Palace of Auburn Hills. McCloskey had six children. His daughter is the writer Molly McCloskey, whose memoir Circles Around the Sun: In Search of a Lost Brother (2011) recounts the story of the McCloskey family with particular focus on Molly's brother (Jack McCloskey's son), Mike.[2][3][4] The family was featured in an article in the September 1953 Ladies Home Journal, as part of a long running series ""How America Lives"", titled ""Meet Mrs. $10,000* Executive in the Home"".

One of the premier guards of the 1950s, McGuire spent eleven seasons in the NBA (1949–60), eight with the New York Knicks and three with the Detroit Pistons. McGuire led the league in assists during his rookie season with a then-record 386 assists,[2] and was among the league's top ten playmakers for ten of his eleven seasons.[3] He was an NBA All-Star seven times (1951,'52, '54-'56, '58, '59), and was named to the All-NBA Second Team in 1951.[3] McGuire became player-coach for the Pistons in his last season (1959–60), and coached them until 1963. He also coached the Knicks for three seasons, beginning in 1965. He compiled a 197-260 coaching record.[4] McGuire was working as a senior consultant for the Knicks when he died on February 3, 2010 of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at age 84.[5] McGuire's brother Al was also a prominent figure in basketball who coached Marquette University to the 1977 NCAA basketball championship. They are the only pair of brothers inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[2] His nephew, Allie, also played in the NBA.

203,Frank McGuire,,"October 11, 1994",,,1962,1962,1,true,,"""[1]""",/coaches/mcguifr99c.html,"Frank Joseph McGuire (November 8, 1913 – October 11, 1994) was an American basketball coach. At the collegiate level, he was head coach for three major programs: St. John's, North Carolina, and South Carolina, winning over a hundred games at each.[1][2] Born in New York City as the youngest of thirteen children in an Irish-American family, to New York police officer,[3] Robert McGuire and his wife, the former Anne Lynch (his father died when Frank was only two years old). He attended Xavier High School graduating in 1933,[4] McGuire graduated from St. John's University in 1936, playing under legendary head coach James ""Buck"" Freeman. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, interrupting his work as a teacher and coach at his high school. Prior to 1947 he also played pro basketball briefly in the American Basketball League. After Joe Lapchick left St. John's to coach the New York Knicks in 1947, McGuire became head basketball and baseball coach at his alma mater. He led the baseball team to the College World Series in 1949 and the basketball team to the Final Four in 1952 – becoming one of only three coaches to achieve both accomplishments. In 1952, McGuire left St. John's to become basketball coach at the University of North Carolina. On paper, this was a significant step down from St. John's, as UNC was not reckoned as a national power at the time. However, school officials wanted a big-name coach to counter the rise of rival North Carolina State under Everett Case. With a roster largely made of players from in and around New York City, McGuire guided North Carolina to an undefeated 32-0 season in 1956-57, capped off by winning the NCAA championship game 54-53 in triple overtime against the Wilt Chamberlain-led Kansas Jayhawks. In 1961, UNC was found guilty of major NCAA violations. Combined with rumors of point shaving by some UNC players, this led Chancellor William Aycock to force McGuire's resignation after the season. At McGuire's suggestion, Aycock named McGuire's top assistant, Dean Smith, as the new coach.[5] Shortly after he left North Carolina in 1961, McGuire became the head coach of the NBA's Philadelphia Warriors and coached Chamberlain during the Warriors' last season in the city. During this season, Chamberlain set his all-time record for scoring average in a season, of 50.4 points per game; additionally, this was the season in which Chamberlain scored 100 points in a single game. The team moved to San Francisco in 1962 and McGuire resigned rather than go west with the team. Following his one season in the NBA, McGuire worked for two years in public relations in New York before returning to college basketball as head coach at the University of South Carolina in 1964. The Gamecocks achieved national prominence under McGuire in his sixth year, going undefeated in ACC play in 1970–one of only two times that an ACC team from the state of South Carolina has won a regular season title (the other being Clemson in 1990). The Gamecocks were denied an NCAA berth when they lost a controversial ACC championship game, in double overtime, to North Carolina State. In those days, only one team per conference was guaranteed a bid to the 25-team field. Ironically, the Gamecocks' home arena, Carolina Coliseum, hosted the NCAA East Regional that same year. The Gamecocks' 25 wins in 1970 were the most in school history until Frank Martin's 2016 team also won 25 games (Martin's 2017 Gamecocks broke the record, with 26 wins). McGuire's Gamecocks won the ACC tournament in 1971–to this day, the only ACC tourney title won by a school from the state of South Carolina. The Gamecocks went independent in 1972, and McGuire would then go on to take the Gamecocks to three more NCAA Tournaments and two National Invitation Tournaments before being forced into retirement after the 1979-80 season. His 283 wins are by far the most in school history. The playing surface at the Gamecocks' former arena, Carolina Coliseum, is named Frank McGuire Arena in his honor. He is also an honorary brother of the Alpha Eta chapter of Phi Kappa Sigma at the University of South Carolina. McGuire holds the record for most victories in a season without a loss, together with Bobby Knight of the 1976 Indiana Hoosiers, at 32-0. He achieved the number one ranking with both the University of North Carolina and South Carolina, and is one of five coaches--John Calipari, Larry Brown, Roy Williams and Rick Pitino are the others—to take two different schools to the NCAA Finals. He is one of 14 coaches, as of 2015, to take multiple schools to the Final Four. The others are: Roy Williams, Lute Olson, Jack Gardner, Forddy Anderson, Larry Brown, Eddie Sutton, John Calipari, Rick Pitino, Gene Bartow, Hugh Durham, Lou Henson, Bob Huggins, and Lee Rose. McGuire was famous for using his New York City ties to enlist players to come south to play at UNC and USC, and was known as one of the top recruiters in the sport, frequently joking about how successful his New York City players, many of them Jewish and Catholic, were in Baptist-prevalent North Carolina and South Carolina. McGuire recruited so many New York City players to UNC and USC that the talent pipeline from NYC to the Carolinas was commonly referred to as the McGuire New York City Railroad. Players that he coached or successfully recruited at the two schools include Lennie Rosenbluth (UNC), Larry Brown (UNC), Donnie Walsh (UNC), Doug Moe (UNC), Billy Cunningham (UNC), Bobby Cremins (USC), John Roche (USC), Tom Owens (USC), Tom Riker (USC), Kevin Joyce (USC), Brian Winters (USC), Mike Dunleavy, Sr. (USC) and Alex English (USC). After having been the first coach to take two different schools to the finals of the NCAA basketball tournament, in 1971 he became the second coach – joining Eddie Hickey – to take three different schools to the NCAA tournament. McGuire was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1977, and retired in 1980. He is the winningest coach in South Carolina history, and is still the third-winningest coach in North Carolina history. He died in Columbia, South Carolina. He is not related to Marquette coach Al McGuire, who was a coaching contemporary of his. However, he did coach both Al and his brother Dick McGuire at St. John's.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/203.png

He is a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, and is regarded as one of the best power forwards of all time. He was named to the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team. McHale began working for the Minnesota Timberwolves immediately following his retirement in 1993 (until 2009), at different times, as a TV analyst, general manager, and finally head coach. He was the head coach of the Houston Rockets from 2011–15, until being fired following a 4–7 start to the 2015–16 season. McHale currently works as an on-air analyst for NBA TV and Turner Sports's popular NBA on TNT studio show. McHale was born to Paul Austin McHale and Josephine Patricia Starcevic in Hibbing, Minnesota.[1] In his senior season at Hibbing High School, he was named Minnesota Mr. Basketball in 1976 and led his team to a runner-up finish in the AA Minnesota State Championship game.[citation needed] He is of Croatian descent on his mother's side and Irish on his father's.[2] The 6 ft 10 in (208 cm) McHale played basketball at the power forward position for the University of Minnesota from 1976 to 1980, with career averages of 15.2 points and 8.5 rebounds per game. He was named All-Big Ten in 1979 and 1980 and still ranks second in school history in career points (1704) and rebounds (950). In 1995, to coincide with the University of Minnesota basketball's 100th anniversary, he was selected as the top player in the history of University of Minnesota men's basketball. McHale is famous for an encounter with Chuck Foreman in the Gopher locker room. Foreman, a famous Minnesota Viking at the time, was congratulating the Gophers on a hard-fought victory. As Foreman was shaking all the players' hands, when he arrived at the then-unknown power forward, McHale displayed his comic wit: ""Nice to meet you, Mr. Foreman. What do you do for a living?""[3] Entering the 1980 NBA draft, the Celtics held the number one overall pick, but in a pre-draft trade, considered by many to be among the most lopsided in NBA history, Celtics president Red Auerbach dealt the pick and an additional first-round pick to the Golden State Warriors for center Robert Parish and the Warriors' first-round pick, the third overall, which the Celtics used to draft McHale. McHale's stay in Boston got off to a rocky start as he held out for a large contract, even threatening to play in Italy,[citation needed] before signing a three-year deal with the Celtics. Backing up Cedric Maxwell at forward, McHale made an immediate impact and was named to the NBA's All-Rookie First Team in his rookie season. Boston finished McHale's rookie season with a league-leading record of 62-20. In the playoffs, the Celtics swept the Chicago Bulls in the first round. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics faced a 3–1 deficit against the Philadelphia 76ers; but Boston won the last three games of the series, including Game 6 on Philadelphia's home court. McHale helped save the Game 6 win by rejecting an Andrew Toney shot and corralling the rebound with 16 seconds left to protect the Celtics' one-point lead. In the NBA Finals, Boston defeated the Houston Rockets in six games to capture the team's fourteenth championship. The Celtics failed to advance to the NBA Finals the next two seasons. Philadelphia exacted a measure of revenge in the 1982 Eastern Conference Final, beating Boston at home in the seventh game. In the 1983 Eastern Conference semifinals, the Celtics were swept by the Milwaukee Bucks. This embarrassing defeat led to the firing of head coach Bill Fitch and a temporarily unhappy McHale. Following the 1982–83 season, McHale's contract with the Celtics expired, and the New York Knicks signed him to a contract offer sheet. Auerbach retaliated by signing three of New York's top free agent players to offer sheets. The Knicks elected to re-sign their players and give up their pursuit of McHale. McHale eventually re-signed with Boston, his $1 million per season contract making him the fourth-highest paid player in the NBA. McHale won the first of his consecutive NBA Sixth Man Awards as Boston won a league-best 62 games in the 1983–84 season. With the hiring of new head coach, former Celtic KC Jones and the acquisition of Phoenix Suns guard Dennis Johnson, Boston seemed primed to make yet another run at a fifteenth championship. After surviving a seven-game semifinal battle with the Knicks, the Celtics avenged the previous season's playoff loss to Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference Finals. Boston would face the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals in a highly anticipated matchup. In Game 4 of the finals, with the Celtics trailing in both the game and the series, McHale delivered a hard foul to Kurt Rambis, violently flinging him down by his throat, as the Lakers' forward raced to the basket. The physical play touched off a bench-clearing scuffle. Boston came back to win the game in overtime and tie the series at two games apiece. They eventually prevailed in seven games to win the franchise's fifteenth championship. McHale continued to come off the bench during first half of the 1984–1985 season, but moved into a starting role in February 1985 after Cedric Maxwell suffered a knee injury. On March 3 versus the Detroit Pistons McHale enjoyed his greatest scoring night, setting the Celtics' single-game scoring record with 56 points.[4] Two nights later McHale scored 42 points against the Knicks, the only other time in his career he topped 40 points in a game. The 98 points in consecutive games is still a Celtics' record. Nine days after McHale had scored 56 points, Larry Bird established a new Celtics' single-game scoring mark by pouring in 60 points versus the Atlanta Hawks. Boston captured its second straight Eastern Conference title but was upended in the NBA Finals in six games by the rival Lakers. McHale led the Celtics in scoring (26.0) and rebounding (10.7) versus the Lakers, including an impressive outing in the series's sixth game, scoring 32 points and grabbing 16 rebounds in defeat. The 1985–1986 edition of the Boston Celtics won the franchise's sixteenth NBA championship and is considered one of the greatest teams in NBA history.[6] The Celtics acquired former NBA Most Valuable Player Bill Walton in a trade from the Los Angeles Clippers in September 1985, and added the 6 ft 11 in (211 cm) center to its already-formidable frontline. Boston sent Cedric Maxwell to the Clippers to complete the trade, clearing the way for McHale to move into a full-time starting role. McHale averaged better than 20 points per game for the first time in his career (21.3) and finished thirteenth in the NBA Most Valuable Player voting. He joined starters Bird, Parish, Johnson and Danny Ainge as the Celtics steamrolled the NBA with a league-best 67–15 record. The team set a then-NBA record by finishing with an 82–18 win-loss record (including playoffs), breaking the record of 81 victories by the 1971–72 Lakers. Boston also set the NBA mark for most home victories in one season, finishing 50–1 (including playoffs) in 48 games in the Boston Garden and three games in Hartford, Connecticut. The Portland Trail Blazers were the only team to beat Boston at home, winning 121–103 in Boston on December 6, 1985. (The Celtics did not lose again at home until more than a year later, when Lakers beat them 117–110 on December 12, 1986.) Boston won 41 of its first 50 games, including two victories over the Lakers. In a rout of the Clippers on December 30, 1985, McHale set his single-game high in rebounds with 18 (a mark he tied against the Pistons in 1989). An extremely durable player through the first five seasons of his career, McHale missed 14 games in early 1986 due to an injured Achilles tendon in his left ankle, but was healthy in time for the playoffs. Boston rolled through the Eastern Conference, winning 11 of 12 games versus Chicago, Atlanta and Milwaukee. For the second time in five years the Celtics faced Houston in the NBA Finals, and Boston won the championship in six games. McHale averaged 25.8 points per game in the finals to lead all scorers. By his seventh pro season, McHale had rehearsed and refined his low-post moves and had become one of the NBA's most dominant offensive forces, out-leaping, out-spinning and outmaneuvering defender after defender in his ""torture chamber"". McHale was never better than in the 1986–1987 season, setting career highs in scoring (26.1) and rebounding (9.9). He also became the first player in NBA history to shoot sixty percent or better from the field (60.4%) and eighty percent or better from the free throw line (83.6%) in the same season. McHale was named to the All-NBA First Team, was named the NBA's best defensive player by the league's coaches, and finished fourth in the Most Valuable Player voting behind Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and teammate Larry Bird. In nine games from February 23 through March 13, 1987, McHale averaged 30.7 points and 10 rebounds per game while shooting 71.7 percent from the floor. During this stretch McHale scored his season-high in points, 38 versus the Pistons on March 1. In a win at Chicago on March 27, McHale broke the navicular bone in his right foot. He ignored doctors' advice that the injury could be career-threatening and continued to play. In the playoffs, a hobbled McHale averaged 39 minutes per game and connected on 58 percent of his shots as Boston again won the Eastern Conference title. Boston swept the Bulls in the first round for the second straight year and survived two epic but bruising seven-game series' with the Bucks and Pistons. The battered and fatigued Celtics - with not only McHale, but also Parish (two sprained ankles) and Ainge (leg injury) playing hurt - then lost to the healthy and refreshed Lakers (who were coming off the easiest path to the finals in modern NBA history) in six games in the 1987 NBA Finals. Off-season surgery on his injured right foot and ankle forced McHale to sit out the first month of the 1987–1988 season. He scored 22 points in 22 minutes of play in his return to the Celtics on December 1, 1987, versus Atlanta. Teammate Danny Ainge once called McHale ""The Black Hole of the low post"", joking that when the basketball was passed inside to McHale it disappeared because he rarely passed it back out to the perimeter. But in a win over the Dallas Mavericks on April 3, 1988, McHale played the role of passer, distributing a career high 10 assists. The Celtics won 57 games and made their fifth straight appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals. McHale shot 60% from the field and averaged a career playoff-high 25.4 points per game as Boston defeated the Knicks in four games and the Hawks in a seven-game semi-final series. Although the Celtics still claimed the best starting five in the NBA, their lack of depth was a key factor in losing to the Detroit Pistons in six games in the conference final. Head coach K. C. Jones retired at season's end, and the Celtics of the Bird-McHale-Parish era would never again advance past the conference semi-finals. Injuries limited Bird to six games in 1988–89 and the Celtics slipped to 42–40. New head coach Jimmy Rodgers coaxed the team into the playoffs as the Eastern Conference's eighth and final seed behind the play of McHale, Parish and second-year guard Reggie Lewis. The Celtics - without the injured Bird - faced the Pistons in the playoffs for the third straight year. Detroit held McHale to 19 points per game and less than 50 percent shooting from the field. The Pistons swept the Celtics en route to their first NBA championship. The 1989–90 season marked the last time McHale was healthy enough to play in all 82 regular season games for the Celtics, but the season was one of discontent for Boston. Second-year point guard Brian Shaw left the team to play in Europe after a salary dispute, and Bird, returning to the court following his various injuries, was criticized by teammates, including McHale, for taking too many shots and trying to dominate games on his own. Rodgers moved McHale back into his old ""sixth man"" role for the majority of the regular season, with Ed Pinckney taking McHale's spot in the starting lineup; McHale's scoring slipped back into the teens coming off the bench. With the Celtics 34-25, Rodgers decided to put McHale into the starting lineup once again. McHale averaged 24.2 points and 9 rebounds down the stretch as the Celtics went 18–5 and finished one game behind Philadelphia in the Atlantic Division. McHale became the first player in twenty years to finish in the NBA's top ten in field goal percentage (seventh) and free throw percentage (fifth) in the same season. Boston took the first two games of its first-round playoff series with the Knicks, including a record-setting 157–128 score in Game 2. The Knicks fought back and won the last three games of the series, upsetting the Celtics. Head coach Jimmy Rodgers was fired following the playoff disappointment. McHale contemplated retirement in the off-season after having another surgery performed on his right ankle, but came back for the 1990–91 season. Boston paired young backcourt players Lewis, Dee Brown, Kevin Gamble and Brian Shaw—back from his year in Europe—with Bird, McHale and Parish and hired Chris Ford, a longtime assistant coach and member of the Celtics' 1981 championship team, to be the team's head coach. Boston jumped out to a 29–5 record, but were soon slowed by injuries to McHale (ankle) and Bird (back). McHale missed 14 regular season games and Bird missed 22, as the Celtics limped to a 27–21 record over the last three months of the season, giving them a 56–26 record and a division title. Boston defeated the Indiana Pacers in five games in a first-round playoff matchup, but in the next round - with Bird missing game one and never close to healthy in the series - for the third time in four years the Celtics were eliminated by Detroit, this time in a six-game semi-final series. McHale played in a career-low 56 games and Bird played in just 45, as each suffered through an injury-plagued 1991–92 season. Boston struggled for most of the regular season but got hot as the playoffs approached, winning 15 of its last 16 games and finishing with 51 wins and a tie for first place in the division with the New York Knicks. Boston had the tie-breaker to give them another Atlantic Division crown; their record was the third-best in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics swept the Pacers in the first round, but were defeated in seven games in the conference semi-finals by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Bird retired from the NBA three months later, after winning a gold medal on the USA basketball Olympic team. The 1992–93 season was McHale's last in the NBA. McHale played in 71 games, but he was severely hampered by leg and back injuries. He averaged 10.7 points per game and shot less than 50 percent from the floor (45.9%) for the only time in his career. In the first round of the NBA playoffs against the Charlotte Hornets the Celtics were stunned by the loss of Lewis, their leading scorer, who collapsed on the court during Game 1 and was diagnosed with what eventually proved to be a fatal heart condition. McHale performed brilliantly in the series. He averaged 19.6 points per game and shot 58 percent from the field—including a reminiscent performance of 30 points and 10 rebounds in Game 2—but Boston fell to the Hornets in four games. McHale announced his retirement while talking with reporters at the scorer's table after the Game 4 loss in Charlotte. McHale was a part of what many consider the league's best-ever frontline with small forward Larry Bird and center Robert Parish. The trio of Hall of Famers became known as the ""Big Three"" and led the Celtics to five NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships, in 1981, 1984 and 1986. For the first five years of his career McHale primarily came off the bench for the Celtics, winning the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 1984 and 1985. Possessing a wide variety of offensive moves close to the basket the agile, long-armed McHale played in seven National Basketball Association All-Star Games between 1984 and 1991. McHale's finest season came in 1986–87 when he was named to the All-NBA First Team as a forward. He led the NBA in field goal percentage in the 1986-87 and 1987-88 seasons, shooting 60.4 percent each season. Also a standout defensive player, McHale was selected to the NBA All-Defensive First or Second Team six times. He twice blocked nine shots in a game, the most ever by a Boston Celtics' player (blocked shots did not become an official NBA statistic until the 1973-74 season). Fellow NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley said of McHale, ""Kevin McHale's the best player I played against because he was unstoppable offensively, and he gave me nightmares on defense.""[7] In 971 regular season games McHale averaged 17.9 points and 7.3 rebounds and in 169 post-season games averaged 18.8 points and 7.4 rebounds.[8] At the end of the 2007–2008 season McHale ranked tenth in NBA history in career field goal percentage (55.4%), and he is among the Celtics' career leaders in several categories, including games played, points scored and rebounding.[9] McHale's number 32 jersey was retired by the Celtics on January 30, 1994, during a halftime ceremony at the Boston Garden [2]. He was chosen one of the NBA's 50 greatest players and was named to the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996.[10] In 1992, McHale was elected to the Minnesota State High School League Hall of Fame. He was elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999.[11] Upon his retirement as an NBA player, McHale joined the Minnesota Timberwolves as a television analyst and ""special assistant"". In the summer of 1994, new Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor promoted him to Assistant General Manager, although he continued to broadcast Timberwolves games as well. In 1995, he was promoted to Vice President of Basketball Operations (i.e., General Manager); one of his first acts was hiring former University of Minnesota teammate Flip Saunders as head coach of the Timberwolves. The next season, McHale decided to select high school forward Kevin Garnett with the fifth overall pick of the 1995 NBA draft. Though Garnett developed into one of the NBA's best players, the Timberwolves advanced past the first round of the playoffs only once in Garnett's twelve seasons with the team. It was also during McHale's reign that the Timberwolves were punished by the NBA for making a secret deal with free agent forward Joe Smith to circumvent the league's salary cap rules. Before the 1998–99 season, Smith secretly agreed to sign three, one-year contracts with the Timberwolves for salary amounts that were much less than what any other NBA teams would have reasonably offered him. In return, Smith received a promise that the Timberwolves would give him a multi-year, multimillion-dollar contract before the 2001–02 season. In 2000, after word of the agreement leaked, NBA commissioner David Stern voided Smith's final one-year contract with the Timberwolves, making Smith a free agent. Stern also stripped three of the Timberwolves' next five first-round draft picks from the team, and fined the team $3.5 million. Smith signed with the Detroit Pistons for one season, but returned to Minnesota before the 2001–2002 season as a free agent. On February 12, 2005, the Timberwolves fired Saunders and McHale took over as head coach for the rest of the 2004–05 season. He compiled a 19–12 record, but had no interest in continuing as head coach at the time. Dwane Casey was hired as the new head coach in the off-season. With Minnesota sitting at .500 midway through the 2006–07 season, McHale fired Casey on January 23, 2007. Timberwolves' assistant coach Randy Wittman was tapped to succeed Casey. Despite missing the playoffs, on April 19, 2007, the Timberwolves announced that McHale and Wittman would return for the 2007–08 season. [3] Prior to the 2007 NBA draft, McHale reportedly tried to work out a trade with Boston Celtics General Manager (and former Celtics teammate) Danny Ainge to trade franchise star Kevin Garnett (frequently named, at the time, the best active player to have never won an NBA championship) to Boston, in exchange for a draft pick and multiple players. Garnett's agent told the Timberwolves and the Celtics that his client had no interest in playing for Boston. (Although Boston had a legitimate star in Paul Pierce, and some solid young players, the team was coming off a 24-win season, and Garnett was not interested in going from one mediocre team to another.) The potential trade was scuttled, for the time being. [4] However, in late June the Celtics swung a draft-day deal with the Seattle Supersonics to acquire sharpshooter and seven-time All-Star Ray Allen. [5] So in late July 2007, when the Timberwolves and the Celtics once again discussed a deal involving Garnett, the prospect of playing alongside both Pierce and Allen caused Garnett to ease his stance on being dealt to Boston; on July 31 he was sent to the Celtics for five players and two first-round draft picks, and the Celtics instantly became viewed as contenders. [6] [7] [8] The very next season, Garnett would go on to help the Celtics win the NBA championship, was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and finished third in the voting for the regular season version of the league's Most Valuable Player award. (Although one of McHale's key acquisitions in the trade - promising power-forward Al Jefferson - would come very close to matching Garnett's statistics from the previous year, and Ryan Gomes (another player acquired in the trade) performed well, the rebuilding team won 10 fewer games its first season without Garnett.) The Timberwolves eventually fired McHale by the end of the 2008–09 season. On December 8, 2008, the Timberwolves fired Wittman. He had compiled a 38–105 record since taking over for Casey. The Timberwolves announced that McHale would step down as VP of Basketball Operations and once again take over the head coaching job, this time more permanently; the Timberwolves' owner Glen Taylor at the time indicated that he was not seeking to replace McHale as head coach.[12] On June 17, 2009, however, it was announced that McHale would not return as the Timberwolves' head coach for the 2009–2010 season,[13] and he was later replaced by Kurt Rambis, whom McHale infamously clotheslined in Game 4 of the 1984 NBA Finals. On June 1, 2011, McHale was named head coach of the Houston Rockets, replacing Rick Adelman.[14][15] On December 24, 2014, McHale signed a three-year contract extension to remain head coach of the Rockets.[16] He led the Rockets to the Western Conference Finals in 2015. However, he was fired on November 18, 2015, after four consecutive losses and a 4–7 start to the 2015–16 season.[17] McHale is one of six members of the 1985–86 Celtics' championship team to have served as an NBA head coach (Larry Bird, Danny Ainge, Dennis Johnson, Sam Vincent and Rick Carlisle are the others). Immediately upon retiring, McHale became the color analyst for Minnesota Timberwolves games for two seasons, from 1993-95. McHale began working for TNT and NBA TV as an on-air, floor-side analyst during the 2009–2010 regular season. He occasionally appeared on the NBA on TNT in-studio show, and even broadcast a few regular season and playoff games for the cable station. During the 2016 NBA Playoffs, McHale served as a guest analyst for the NBA on TNT's coverage. On October 10, 2016, he signed a multi-year agreement to return to Turner Sports.[18] McHale was also a part of the studio team for NBA TV's Fan Night broadcasts on Tuesday nights during the season (along with Ernie Johnson, Chris Webber and Greg Anthony since the 2016–17 season). McHale also called games for the station during the 2010 Las Vegas Summer League. On June 30, 1982, McHale married his wife Lynn. They had five children: Kristyn, Michael, Joseph, Alexandra and Thomas. On November 24, 2012, Alexandra died at age 23, after being hospitalized for lupus for 14 days.[19] McHale is of Irish and Croat origin.[20] McHale guest-starred as himself in two episodes of the TV series Cheers: ""Cheers Fouls Out"" (Season 9, Episode 2) and ""Where Have All The Floorboards Gone"" (Season 10, Episode 8).[21] The latter episode also featured Lynn McHale.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/204.png

He also played for the Boston Celtics. His final year with the Capitols (in the 1950–51 season), McKinney was a player-coach; the team folded midway through the season. McKinney, known for his sideline antics, would later coach the Wake Forest University Demon Deacons, leading them to two Atlantic Coast Conference titles and an appearance in the Final Four in 1962. McKinney also coached Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association from 1969 through 1971. He coached them to a 42–42 record during the 1969–70 season, good for third place in the East Division. The Cougars then lost in the first round of the 1970 ABA playoffs to the Indiana Pacers, 4 games to 0. As the 1970–71 season got under way, McKinney was named a vice president of the team.

As a head coach in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Los Angeles Lakers, he introduced an up-tempo style of play that became known as Showtime. However, his only season with the Lakers ended prematurely after a bicycle accident. McKinney joined the Indiana Pacers, where he was named NBA Coach of the Year in 1981. He also coached the Kansas City Kings (now known as the Sacramento Kings). In addition, he served as an assistant for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Portland Trail Blazers. McKinney was born in Chester, Pennsylvania, to Paul McKinney, a police detective, and Jen McMahon, a homemaker.[2] He attended St. James High in Chester, where he played basketball under coach Jack Ramsay. He graduated in 1953.[3][4] McKinney went to college at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. He played three seasons for the Hawks, who were also coached by Ramsey, and led the team to the Big 5's inaugural title and the school's first ever postseason in the 1956 National Invitation Tournament (NIT).[3] He was also a member of their track and field team.[4] McKinney coached one season at St. James in 1959–60, leading them to a 17–11 record.[3] After five years at his alma mater St. Joseph's as an assistant under Ramsay, McKinney was the head coach at Philadelphia Textile for one season in 1965–66. He returned to St. Joe's in 1966, replacing the departed Ramsay as head coach.[5] McKinney is a member of the Saint Joseph's and the Big 5 Halls of Fame.[3] He was also named the Eastern Coach of the Year by Philadelphia sportswriters for his 1973–74 season when the Hawks, predicted to have a poor year after graduating Mike Bantom to the NBA and Pat McFarland to the American Basketball Association (ABA), had a stellar season again winning their conference and qualifying for postseason play.[6][7] However, he was fired after a first-round loss in the 1974 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament, and his dismissal prompted a demonstration by over 500 students.[2][7] McKinney was an NBA assistant coach with Milwaukee and Portland, and won an NBA championship with the Trail Blazers under Ramsay in 1976–77.[2] He received his first NBA head coaching job in 1979–80 with the Lakers. Owner Jerry Buss, who had recently acquired the team, wanted games to be entertaining, and hired the coach to install a running offense.[8][9] McKinney had 6-foot-9-inch (2.06 m) rookie Magic Johnson, who some thought should play forward, be a point guard, even though incumbent Norm Nixon was already one of the best in the league.[10][11][12] On November 8, 1979, the Lakers were 9–4 after 13 games, when McKinney suffered a near fatal head injury after falling while bicycling.[2] Assistant coach Paul Westhead, who also worked under McKinney at St. Joseph's, was named the interim head coach.[12] However, the length of the recovery and lingering doubts about the complete return of McKinney's mental faculties, combined with the team's level of success under Westhead, ultimately meant that McKinney would never get the chance to return to the job. Westhead continued to use McKinney's offense, a creative and spontaneous offense that came to be known as Showtime,[12][13][14] and the team finished the season with a record of 60–22.[2] The Lakers advanced to that year's NBA Finals, when McKinney was fired mid-series on May 13, 1980.[15][16] The Lakers won the series for their first of five NBA titles in nine seasons, and hired Westhead to permanently replace McKinney.[17] Pat Riley, who replaced Westhead as Lakers coach, won four titles with the team and became the coach most synonymous with the Showtime Lakers.[2][18] However, Norm Nixon credited McKinney with creating Showtime. ""That should never be forgotten"", said Nixon.[19] According to Riley, McKinney ""might have won five or six titles for the Lakers in the '80s"" were it not for his accident.[2] McKinney was deferential. ""I just put in some ideas that were accepted, and the rest was up to Paul and Pat and some great players"", he said.[2] McKinney joined Indiana the following season in 1980–81.[19] He was hired at the insistence of a guilt-ridden Buss, who was business partners with Pacers owner Frank Mariani.[19][20] In his first season, McKinney was named the NBA Coach of the Year after leading the Pacers to their first playoff appearance since the former American Basketball Association (ABA) team joined the NBA during the ABA–NBA merger of 1976. Over the next three seasons, however, the team's performance regressed, and McKinney was fired after the Pacers posted the league's worst record in the 1983-84 season. He was soon hired as the head coach the Kansas City Kings, but resigned from the position on November 18, 1984 after the team started with a 1–8 record in the 1984-85 season.[21] In 2005, McKinney co-authored a book about his experiences at Saint Joseph's, and donated 10 percent of its proceeds to the school.[3] McKinney died on September 25, 2018, at a hospice in Bonita Springs, Florida, at the age of 83.[2]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/207.png

He coached the Seattle SuperSonics from 2000 to 2005, and the Portland Trail Blazers from 2005 to 2012. McMillan grew up in the heart of North Carolina's basketball country and attended Raleigh's William G. Enloe High School, where he went unnoticed by major college scouts. After playing for two years at Chowan College (then a two-year school) in Murfreesboro, North Carolina,[1][2] he returned to Raleigh to play for Jim Valvano at North Carolina State, before entering the NBA. McMillan helped lead NC State to a first-place tie in the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season in 1985, and the Elite Eight in both the 1985 and 1986 NCAA Championship Tournaments. McMillan was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics with the 30th pick in the 1986 draft. He would spend his entire NBA career in Seattle. During his 12-year playing career, McMillan put up career averages of 5.9 points, 6.1 assists and 1.9 steals. He still shares (with Ernie DiGregorio) the NBA rookie record for assists in a single game with 25. McMillan played as the starting point guard position for the SuperSonics for most of his career.[3] McMillan was known for his superb defense, leading the NBA in steals per game for the 1993–94 season and being named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team for the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons. McMillan was also known for his balanced play, which led to four career triple-doubles. In the 1995–96 season, McMillan helped the SuperSonics reach the NBA Finals against the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls. The SuperSonics were the only team to beat the Bulls three times that season (once in the regular season and twice in the playoffs).[4] Known as ""Mr. Sonic"" for his 19 years of service to the team, his no. 10 jersey was retired by the SuperSonics. He was also known to be one-third of the ""Big Mac"" team of the SuperSonics in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the others being Xavier McDaniel and Derrick McKey.[citation needed] After retiring in 1998, McMillan stayed in Seattle as an assistant under Paul Westphal. He held this role until 2000 when the Sonics fired Westphal and made McMillan interim coach. Although the team missed the playoffs during his first year, he earned a winning record of 38–29 as interim head coach. He was hired as head coach for the 2001–02 campaign and led the club to the playoffs.[5] As a result, he was named permanent head coach after the season. McMillan's Sonics had mediocre records the next two years, going 40–42 and 37–45. In the 2004–05 season, he led the team to 52–30 record in the regular season.[5] The team advanced to the Western Conference Semifinals, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs.[6] After 19 years in Seattle, McMillan left Seattle on July 6, 2005, to become the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.[7] He took over a team riddled with cap problems and off-the-court drama, but steadily calmed the waters in Portland. His hard-nosed coaching style earned him the nickname ""Sarge.""[4] On December 5, 2009, McMillan ruptured his right Achilles tendon while scrimmaging with the Trail Blazers during practice.[8] He coached much of the season in a protective boot after surgery and led the team to 50 wins in spite of a historic number of injuries to his key players.[citation needed] McMillan coached the Blazers until March 15, 2012.[9] McMillan was an assistant coach under Mike Krzyzewski for the US national team in the 2006 FIBA World Championship and in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, winning bronze and gold medals, respectively.[10] He is also a member of the National Junior College Basketball Hall of Fame, due to his All-American performance at Chowan. McMillan again served as an assistant coach under Krzyzewski for the US national team during the 2012 London Summer Olympics.[11] On July 1, 2013, McMillan was hired by the Indiana Pacers as an assistant coach for the 2013–14 season.[12] He replaced Brian Shaw, who accepted the head coaching position with the Denver Nuggets.[13] In May 2016, after former head coach Frank Vogel's contract was not extended, McMillan was promoted to replace Vogel as the Pacers' coach.[14] His son Jamelle played as a guard for the Arizona State Sun Devils[15] and is currently an assistant coach with the New Orleans Pelicans.[16]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/210.png

212,George Mikan,"June 18, 1924","June 1, 2005","Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary in Chicago, Illinois",DePaul,1958,1958,1,true,,"""[1]""",/coaches/mikange01c.html,"George Lawrence Mikan Jr. (June 18, 1924 – June 1, 2005), nicknamed Mr. Basketball, was a dominant American professional basketball player for the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League (NBL) and the Minneapolis Lakers of the NBL, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA). Invariably playing with thick, round spectacles, the 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), 245 lb (111 kg) Mikan is seen as one of the pioneers of professional basketball, redefining it as a game of so-called big men with his prolific rebounding, shot blocking, and his talent to shoot over smaller defenders with his ambidextrous hook shot, the result of his namesake Mikan Drill.[1] He also utilized the underhanded free-throw shooting technique long before Rick Barry made it his signature shot.[2] Mikan had a successful playing career, winning seven NBL, BAA, and NBA championships, an NBA All-Star Game MVP trophy, and three scoring titles. He was a member of the first four NBA All-Star games, and the first six All-BAA and All-NBA Teams. Mikan was so dominant that he prompted several rule changes in the NBA: among them, the introduction of the goaltending rule, the widening of the foul lane—known as the ""Mikan Rule""—and the creation of the shot clock.[3] After his playing career, Mikan became one of the founders of the American Basketball Association (ABA), serving as commissioner of the league. He was instrumental in forming the Minnesota Timberwolves. In his later years, Mikan was involved in a long-standing legal battle against the NBA, to increase the meager pensions of players who had retired before the league became lucrative. In 2005, Mikan died after a long battle with diabetes.[4] For his accomplishments, Mikan was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980, and was elected one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. Since April 2001, a statue of Mikan shooting his trademark hook shot graces the entrance of the Timberwolves' Target Center.[3] George Mikan was born in Joliet, Illinois, and was of Croatian descent. As a boy, he shattered one of his knees so badly that he was kept in bed for a year and a half. In 1938, Mikan attended the Chicago Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary and originally wanted to be a priest, but then moved back home to finish at Joliet Catholic.[5] Mikan did not seem destined to become an athlete. When Mikan entered Chicago's DePaul University in 1942, he stood 6' 10"", weighed 245 pounds, moved awkwardly because of his frame, and wore thick glasses for his nearsightedness.[6] However, Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul basketball coach Ray Meyer, who saw potential in the bright and intelligent, but also clumsy and shy, freshman. Put into perspective, Meyer's thoughts were revolutionary, because at the time it was believed that tall players were too awkward to ever play basketball well.[5] In the following months, Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident, aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it. Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively, and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand. This routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill.[6] In addition, Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag, take dancing lessons, and jump rope to make him a complete athlete.[4] Mikan dominated his peers from the start of his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college games at DePaul. He intimidated opponents with his size and strength, was unstoppable on offense with his hook shot, and soon established a reputation as one of the hardest and grittiest players in the league, often playing through injuries and punishing opposing centers with hard fouls.[5] In addition, Mikan also surprised the basketball world with his unique ability of goaltending, i.e. jumping so high that he swatted the ball away before it could pass the hoop. In today's basketball, touching the ball after it reaches its apex is a violation, but in Mikan's time it was legal because people thought it was impossible anyone could reach that high. ""We would set up a zone defense that had four men around the key and I guarded the basket"", Mikan later recalled his DePaul days. ""When the other team took a shot, I'd just go up and tap it out."" As a consequence, the NCAA, and later the NBA, outlawed goaltending.[1] Bob Kurland, a seven-footer from Oklahoma A&M, was one of the few opposing centers to have any success against Mikan.[7] Mikan was named the Helms NCAA College Player of the Year in 1944 and 1945 and was an All-American three times. In 1945, he led DePaul to the NIT title, which at that time was as prestigious as the NCAA title.[8] Mikan led the nation in scoring with 23.9 points per game in 1944–45 and 23.1 in 1945–46. When DePaul won the 1945 NIT, Mikan was named Most Valuable Player for scoring 120 points in three games, including 53 points in a 97–53 win over Rhode Island; his 53-point total equaled the score of the entire Rhode Island team.[6] After the end of the 1945–46 college season, Mikan signed with the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League, a predecessor of the modern NBA. He played with them for 25 games at the end of the 1946–47 NBL season, scoring 16.5 points per game as a rookie. Mikan led the Gears to the championship of the World Basketball Tournament, where he was elected Most Valuable Player after scoring 100 points in five games, and also voted into the All-NBL Team.[1][6] However, before the start of the 1947–48 NBL season, Maurice White, the president of the American Gear Company and the owner of the American Gears NBL team, pulled the team out of the league. White planned to create a 24-team league called the Professional Basketball League of America, in which he owned all the teams and arenas. However, the league folded after just a month, and the players of White's teams were equally distributed among the 11 remaining NBL franchises. As a consequence, every team had a 9.09% chance of landing Mikan, who ended up on the Minneapolis Lakers, playing for coach John Kundla.[1] In his first season with the Lakers, Mikan led the league in scoring with 1,195 points, becoming the only NBL player to score more than 1,000 points in an NBL season.[9] He was named league MVP, and the Lakers won the NBL title. The following year, the Lakers and three other NBL franchises jumped to the fledgling Basketball Association of America. Mikan led his new league in scoring, and again set a single-season scoring record. The Lakers defeated the Washington Capitols in the 1949 BAA Finals. In 1949, the BAA and NBL merged to form the NBA. The new league started the inaugural 1949–50 NBA season, featuring 17 teams, with the Lakers in the Central Division. Mikan again was dominant, averaging 27.4 points per game and 2.9 assists per game and taking another scoring title;[10] Alex Groza of Indianapolis Olympians was the only other player to break the 20-point-barrier that year.[1] After comfortably leading his team to an impressive 51–17 record and storming through the playoffs, Mikan's team played the 1950 NBA Finals against the Syracuse Nationals. In Game 1, the Lakers beat Syracuse on their home court when Lakers reserve guard Bob Harrison hit a 40-foot buzzer beater to give Minneapolis a two-point win. The team split the next four games, and in Game 6, the Lakers won 110–95 and won the first-ever NBA championship. Mikan scored 31.3 points per game in the playoffs.[1] In the 1950–51 NBA season, Mikan was dominant again, scoring a career-best 28.4 points per game in the regular season, again taking the scoring crown, and had 3.1 assists per game.[10] In that year, the NBA introduced a new statistic: rebounds. In this category, Mikan also stood out; his 14.1 rebounds per game (rpg) was only second to the 16.4 rpg of Dolph Schayes of Syracuse.[10] In that year, Mikan participated in one of the most notorious NBA games ever played. When the Fort Wayne Pistons played against his Lakers, the Pistons took a 19–18 lead. Afraid that Mikan would mount a comeback if he got the ball, the Pistons passed the ball around without any attempt to score a basket.[11] With no shot clock invented yet to force them into offense, the score stayed 19–18 to make it the lowest-scoring NBA game of all time. This game was an important factor in the development of the shot clock, which was introduced four years later. Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers' 18 points, thus scoring 83.3% of his team's points, setting an NBA all-time record.[11] In the postseason, Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals. With Mikan hardly able to move all series long, the Royals won 3–1. Decades later, in 1990, Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate; however, despite effectively hopping around the court on one foot, he said he still averaged 20-odd points per game.[1] In the 1951–52 NBA season, the NBA decided to widen the foul lane under the basket from 6 feet to 12 feet. As players could stay in the lane for only three seconds at a time, it forced big men like Mikan to post-up from double the distance.[1] A main proponent of this rule was New York Knicks coach Joe Lapchick, who regarded Mikan as his nemesis, and it was dubbed ""The Mikan Rule"".[12] While Mikan still scored an impressive 23.8 points per game, it was a serious reduction from his 27.4 points per game the previous season, and his field goal percentage sank from .428 to .385. He still pulled down 13.5 rebounds per game, asserting himself as a top rebounder, and logged 3.0 assists per game.[10] Mikan also had a truly dominating game that season—on January 20, 1952, he scored a personal-best 61 points in a 91-81 double overtime victory against the Rochester Royals. At the time, it was the second-best scoring performance in league history behind Joe Fulks' 63-point game in 1949. Mikan's output more than doubled that of his teammates, who combined for 30 points. He also grabbed 36 rebounds, a record at the time. In the 1952 NBA All-Star Game, Mikan had a strong performance with 26 points and 15 rebounds in a West loss. Later that season, the Lakers reached the 1952 NBA Finals and were pitted against the New York Knicks. This qualified as one of the strangest Finals series in NBA history, as neither team could play on their home court in the first six games. The Lakers' Minneapolis Auditorium was already booked, and the Knicks' Madison Square Garden was occupied by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Instead, the Lakers played in St. Paul and the Knicks in the damp, dimly lit 69th Regiment Armory. Perpetually double-teamed by Knicks' Nat Clifton and Harry Gallatin, Mikan was unable to assert himself and it was more Vern Mikkelsen's credit that the first six games were split. In the only true home game, Game 7 in the Auditorium, the Lakers won 82–65 and edged the Knicks 4–3, winning the NBA title and earning themselves $7,500 to split among the team.[12] During the 1952–53 NBA season, Mikan averaged 20.6 points and a career-high 14.4 rebounds per game, the highest in the league, as well as 2.9 assists per game.[10] In the 1953 NBA All-Star Game, Mikan was dominant again with 22 points and 16 rebounds, winning that game's MVP Award. The Lakers made the 1953 NBA Finals, and again defeated the Knicks 4–1.[1] In the 1953–54 NBA season, the now 29-year-old Mikan slowly declined, averaging 18.1 points, 14.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game.[10] Under his leadership, the Lakers won another NBA title in the 1954 NBA Finals, making it their third-straight championship and fifth in six years; the only time they lost had been when Mikan fractured his leg. From an NBA perspective, the Minneapolis Lakers dynasty has only been convincingly surpassed by the eleven-title Boston Celtics dynasty of 1957–69.[1] At the end of the season, Mikan announced his retirement. He later said: ""I had a family growing, and I decided to be with them. I felt it was time to get started with the professional world outside of basketball."" Injuries also were a factor, as Mikan had sustained 10 broken bones and 16 stitches in his career, often having to play through these injuries.[1] Without Mikan, the Lakers made the playoffs, but were unable to reach the 1955 NBA Finals. In the middle of the 1955–56 NBA season, Mikan returned to the Lakers lineup. He played in 37 games, but his long absence had affected his play. He averaged only 10.5 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists,[10] and the Lakers lost in the first round of the playoffs. At the end of the season, Mikan retired for good. His 10,156 points were a record at the time; he was the first NBA player to score 10,000 points in a career.[13] He was inducted into the inaugural Basketball Hall of Fame class of 1959 and was declared the greatest player of the first half of the century by The Associated Press.[1] In 1956, Mikan was the Republican candidate for the United States Congress in Minnesota's 3rd congressional district. He challenged incumbent Representative Roy Wier in a closely fought race that featured a high voter turnout. Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52% to 48%. Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan's 117,716. Returning to the legal profession, Mikan was frustrated after hoping for an influx of work. For six months, Mikan did not get any assignments at all, leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him to cash in on his life insurance.[14] Problems also arose in Mikan's professional sports career. In the 1957–58 NBA season, Lakers coach John Kundla became general manager and persuaded Mikan to become coach of the Lakers. However, this was a failure, as the Lakers endured a 9–30 record until Mikan stepped down and returned coaching duties to Kundla. The Lakers ended with a 19–53 record, to record one of the worst seasons in their history.[1] After this failure, Mikan then concentrated on his law career, raising his family of six children, successfully specializing in corporate and real estate law, and buying and renovating buildings in Minneapolis.[1] In 1967, Mikan returned to professional basketball, becoming the first commissioner of the American Basketball Association, a rival league to the NBA. In order to lure basketball fans to his league, Mikan invented the league's characteristic red-white-and-blue ABA ball, which he thought more patriotic, better suited for TV, and more crowd-pleasing than the brown NBA ball,[1] and instituted the three-point line. Mikan resigned from the ABA in 1969. In the mid-1980s, Mikan headed a task force with a goal of returning professional basketball to Minneapolis, decades after the Lakers had moved to Los Angeles to become the Los Angeles Lakers, and after the ABA's Minnesota Muskies and Minnesota Pipers had departed. This bid was successful, leading to the inception of a new franchise in the 1989–90 NBA season, the Minnesota Timberwolves.[1] In 1994, Mikan became the part-owner and chairman of the board of the Chicago Cheetahs, a professional roller hockey team based in Chicago, that played in Roller Hockey International. The franchise folded after their second season. In his later years, Mikan suffered from diabetes and failing kidneys, and eventually, his illness caused his right leg to be amputated below the knee. When his medical insurance was cut off, Mikan soon found himself in severe financial difficulties.[5] He fought a long and protracted legal battle against the NBA and the NBA Players' Union, protesting the $1,700/month pensions for players who had retired before 1965, the start of the so-called ""big money era"". According to Mel Davis of the National Basketball Retired Players Union, this battle kept him going, because Mikan hoped to be alive when a new collective bargaining agreement would finally vindicate his generation. In 2005, however, his condition worsened.[4][11] In 1947, he married his girlfriend, Patricia, and they remained together for 58 years until his passing. The couple had six children, sons Larry, Terry, Patrick and Michael, and daughters Trisha and Maureen.[11] All his life, Mikan was universally seen as the prototypical ""gentle giant"", tough and relentless on the court, but friendly and amicable in private life.[11] He was also the older brother of Ed Mikan, another basketball player for DePaul, the BAA, and the Philadelphia Warriors of the NBA. Mikan died in Scottsdale, Arizona, on June 1, 2005, of complications from diabetes and other ailments. His son Terry reported that his father had undergone dialysis three times a week, four hours a day, for the last five years.[4][11] He is interred at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis. Mikan's death was widely mourned by the basketball world,[4] and also brought media attention to the financial struggles of several early-era NBA players. Many felt that the current players of the big-money generation should rally for larger pensions for the pre-1965 predecessors in upcoming labor negotiations. Shaquille O'Neal paid for Mikan's funeral. He said: ""Without number 99 [Mikan], there is no me."" Before Game 5 of the 2005 Eastern Conference Finals between the Heat and the Detroit Pistons, there was a moment of silence to honor Mikan. Bob Cousy remarked that Mikan figuratively carried the NBA in the early days and single-handedly made the league credible and popular.[4] The 2005 NBA Finals between the Pistons and the San Antonio Spurs was dedicated to Mikan.[citation needed] Mikan is lauded as the pioneer of the modern age of basketball. He was the original center, who scored 11,764 points, an average of 22.6 per game, retired as the all-time leading scorer and averaged 13.4 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 520 NBL, BAA and NBA games. As a testament to his fierce playing style, he also led the league three times in personal fouls.[3][6] He won seven NBL, BAA, and NBA championships, an All-Star MVP trophy, and three scoring titles, and was a member of the first four NBA All-Star games and the first six All-BAA and All-NBA Teams. As well as being declared the greatest player of the first half of the century by The Associated Press, Mikan was on the Helms Athletic Foundation all-time All-American team, chosen in a 1952 poll, made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980 and was elected one of the NBA 50 Greatest Players in 1996.[1][3][6] Mikan was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in its inaugural 1959 class, the first NBA player inducted into the Hall. Mikan's impact on the game is also reflected in the Mikan Drill, today a staple exercise of ""big men"" in basketball. When superstar center Shaquille O'Neal became a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, Mikan appeared on a Sports Illustrated cover in November 1996 with O'Neal and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, calling Abdul-Jabbar and Mikan the ""Lakers legends"" to whom O'Neal was compared. Since April 2001, a statue of Mikan shooting his trademark hook shot graces the entrance of the Minnesota Timberwolves' Target Center.[3] In addition, a banner in the Staples Center commemorates Mikan and his fellow Minneapolis Lakers. He is also honored by a statue and an appearance on a mural in his hometown of Joliet, Illinois. Mikan became so dominant that the NBA had to change its rules of play in order to reduce his influence, such as widening the lane from six to twelve feet (""The Mikan Rule""). He also played a role in the introduction of the shot clock; and in the NCAA, his dominating play around the basket led to the outlawing of defensive goaltending. Mikan was a harbinger of the NBA's future, which would be dominated by tall, powerful players.[1][3] As an official, Mikan is also directly responsible for the ABA three-point line which was later adopted by the NBA; the existence of the Minnesota Timberwolves;[1] and the multi-colored ABA ball, which still lives on as the ""money ball"" in the NBA All-Star Three-Point Contest.[15]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/212.png

Mitchell Jr. (born September 2, 1963) is a former professional basketball player and coach. Playing at small forward, Mitchell's 18-year professional basketball career spanned three decades, and was most notable for his ten seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves (NBA), whom he also coached as an interim for the 2015-16 season. Mitchell coached for the Toronto Raptors 2004 to 2008 as well, winning Coach of the Year Award in 2007. Mitchell has since worked as an analyst for TSN, NBA TV, and works as a talk show co-host/analyst on SiriusXM NBA Radio. Mitchell graduated from Columbus High School in 1981. He spent the next four years playing college basketball at Mercer University (1981–85), and scored nearly 2,000 points, becoming the leading scorer in Bears history. He led the team to both the regular-season and postseason Trans-American Atlantic Conference championships in 1985. Averaging 25 points and 8.2 rebounds per game as a senior, Mitchell led the Bears to just their second NCAA tournament in team history in 1985; they would not return for nearly 30 years, until the 2014 tournament. Mitchell had enlisted in the Army during his junior year, and at the conclusion of the 1985 NCAA tournament he went to boot camp at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He left one month later when he was drafted by the Houston Rockets with the 7th pick of the 3rd round (54th overall) in the 1985 NBA draft. However he was cut during final cuts and joined the Wisconsin Flyers of the Continental Basketball Association. Unhappy in the CBA, Mitchell quit the team midway through the season to return home to Georgia, where a former professor hired him a Special Education teacher for the remainder of the school year. With his summer off, he tried out for the U.S. Basketball League, and joined the Tampa Bay Flash, who he helped lead to the league title. He rejoined the Rockets for training camp afterwards, but was once again cut and joined the CBA, splitting the season between the Wisconsin Flyers and Rapid City Thrillers. He then joined the French Ligue Nationale de Basketball team of Montpellier (coached by Pierre Galle) for the end of the 1987–88 and the whole 1988–89 season. Success overseas led to a renewed interest from the NBA, and Mitchell earned a contract with the newly formed Minnesota Timberwolves. He spent three years in Minnesota, before being traded to the Indiana Pacers. While having a smaller role with the Pacers than he did with the Timberwolves, Mitchell did help Indiana reach the Eastern Conference Finals in 1994-95. Following that season, he returned to the Minnesota. Kevin Garnett was drafted by the Timberwolves out of high school that year, and Mitchell has been credited with helping Garnett's development. Mitchell retired from the league following the 2001-02 season. Mitchell returned to the NBA almost immediately after his retirement as an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks for two seasons until 2004. He then briefly became a part of the expansion Charlotte Bobcats as their top assistant coach, until moving on to the Toronto Raptors when he was named as the sixth head coach in Raptors history after incumbent Kevin O'Neill was fired. Mitchell was named the coach of the month in January 2007 for his effort bringing the Toronto Raptors back to .500 and leading the Atlantic Division. On March 30, 2007, Mitchell got his 100th win as NBA coach when the Raptors defeated the Washington Wizards at the Verizon Center.[1] Mitchell, who witnessed his team struggle with rebuilding in his first years as coach, also led the Toronto Raptors to their first division title in franchise history as the team won the Atlantic Division in the NBA's Eastern Conference in the 2006–07 season. On April 24, 2007, he was named 2006–07 NBA Coach of the Year.[2] On May 22, 2007 after leading the Raptors to their first playoffs appearance since 2002, and after much speculation, Mitchell was signed to a four-year contract with the Raptors.[3] On November 25, 2007 Mitchell surpassed Lenny Wilkens for the most wins in team history. Mitchell was the longest reigning head coach of the Toronto Raptors. On December 3, 2008, after leading the Raptors to a disappointing 8–9 start to the 2008–09 season, Mitchell was relieved of his duties as the team's head coach. Assistant coach Jay Triano took over the position of interim head coach of the Raptors, which later made him the first foreign-born player to coach a team in the NBA.[4] The firing was ridiculed by the TNT Overtime crew because the Raptors were only one game under .500 at the time of the firing. Chris Webber predicted that they would not be ""as good under another coach.""[5] In fact, the Raptors went 25–40 the rest of the season. Mitchell was hired as an assistant coach by the New Jersey Nets on July 19, 2010. On December 6, 2011, Nets hired P.J. Carlesimo and Mario Elie as new assistant coaches and Mitchell was reassigned to a scouting position. On 2012, Sam Mitchell named head coach of USA select to 2012 William Jones Cup in Taiwan and his team finished bronze medal. On June 16, 2014, Mitchell was hired as an assistant coach by the Minnesota Timberwolves.[6] On September 11, 2015, Mitchell became the Timberwolves' interim head coach after Flip Saunders had to take a leave of absence to receive treatment after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma.[7] On October 25, 2015, Saunders died at age 60. For the rest of the season, Mitchell became the official head coach, although he would still be treated as an interim coach. During his sole season coaching the Timberwolves, he would coach them to the fifth-worst record in the league with a 29–53 record. On April 13, 2016, Mitchell was relieved of his interim head coaching duties as the coach of the Timberwolves after the last game of the season, allowing them to look for a permanent coach.[8] He would then be replaced by former Chicago Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau.

215,Doug Moe,"September 21, 1938",,"The Bullis School in Potomac, Maryland",UNC,1977,1993,15,true,,"""[2, 8, 2]""",/coaches/moedo01c.html,"Douglas Edwin Moe (born September 21, 1938) is an American former professional basketball player and coach. As a head coach with the Denver Nuggets in the National Basketball Association (NBA), he was named the NBA Coach of the Year in 1988. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Moe was a star player at the University of North Carolina where he was a two-time All-American. However, his collegiate career ended in controversy when he admitted to being associated with a point shaving scandal.[1] Moe received $75 from fix conspirator Aaron Wagman to fly to a meeting in New Jersey, arranged by Moe's friend conspirator Lou Brown, but Moe reportedly turned down an offer to throw games. There is no evidence that Moe was ever involved in a fix conspiracy, but his ties to the scandal blemished his reputation.[2] He was selected in the NBA draft in 1960 by the Detroit Pistons and again in 1961 with the Chicago Packers, but began his pro career in the top level Italian league, with the Pallacanestro Petrarca Padova,[3] and later in the American Basketball Association with the New Orleans Buccaneers, Oakland Oaks, Washington Caps, Carolina Cougars and Virginia Squires. He garnered ABA All-Star honors three times in an injury-shortened five-year professional playing career. Moe became a head coach in 1976–77, after serving as an assistant coach for the Carolina Cougars. Moe worked behind the bench for 15 years, ten of them with the Denver Nuggets. He also had stops in San Antonio and Philadelphia. Moe began his coaching career with the Carolina Cougars in the ABA as an assistant coach to his UNC teammate Larry Brown from 1972 to 1974. He then followed Brown to Denver, where they coached the Nuggets from 1974 to 1976. During those two seasons, the Nuggets were 125–43 (.744). They advanced to the ABA Finals in 1976, but lost to the New York Nets in six games. After the ABA–NBA merger in 1976, Moe served as a head coach for the San Antonio Spurs for four seasons (1976–80), leading them to a conference finals appearance in 1979. He returned to Denver in 1980 to take over the head coaching reins from another UNC alum, Donnie Walsh. From 1980 to 1990, Moe compiled a 432–357 (.548) record and led the Nuggets to the postseason nine-straight years—advancing as far as the Western Conference Finals in 1985. He guided the Nuggets to two Midwest Division titles (1984–85 and ’87–88) and a franchise-record 54 wins in 1987–88. He was named NBA Coach of the Year that same year. Under Moe's direction, the Nuggets high-octane offense led the league in scoring in six of his 10 seasons in Denver. He is honored by the Nuggets with a banner that reads ""432"" for his number of wins as a Nuggets' head coach. Moe also served an unsuccessful stint as a head coach for the Philadelphia 76ers (1992–93), with his son David Moe as an assistant coach. In 1979, he led the Spurs to the conference finals. His overall NBA head coaching ledger stands at 628–529 (.543) and his wins are the 19th-most in NBA history, though he is not in the Hall of Fame. Moe used a run-and-gun offense which had his team shoot before the opponent's defense had set up.[4] He ran almost no plays, instead relying on ball movement, screens and constant cuts to the basket. Players were not to hold onto the ball for longer than two seconds. The movement of the ball was predicated on what the defense allowed. ""You can't diagram it, you can't put a pencil and paper to it. If you do, you're doing an injustice to the system"", said former Nuggets assistant Allan Bristow. Moe simply said, ""The passing game is basically doing whatever the hell you want.""[5] Moe's passing strategy was adopted from North Carolina head coach Dean Smith. Smith, normally a conservative coach, thought that the passing game could work with the right players, but he did not believe players would be smart enough to execute it at all times.[5] Though his offensive strategy led to high scores, Moe's Denver teams were never adept at running fast breaks. His teams at times appeared to give up baskets in order to get one. He disputed the fact that his teams did not play defense, attributing the high scores to the pace of the game.[5] ""One of the biggest disappointments in my life was going into the NBA after the merger. The NBA was a rinky-dink league—listen, I'm very serious about this. The league was run like garbage. There was no camaraderie; a lot of the NBA guys were aloof and thought they were too good to practice or play hard. The NBA All-Star Games were nothing—guys didn't even want to play in them and the fans could [sic] care less about the games. It wasn't until the 1980s, when David Stern became commissioner, that the NBA figured out what the hell they were doing, and what they did was a lot of stuff we had in the ABA—from the 3-point shot to All-Star weekend to the show biz stuff. Now the NBA is like the old ABA. Guys play hard, they show their enthusiasm and there is a closeness in the league. Hell, the ABA might have lost the battle, but we won the war. The NBA now plays our kind of basketball.""[6] Sports portal",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/215.png

He boasts 31 winning seasons in his 32 years as a head coach at Berkeley, Stanford and Montana. Montgomery's Stanford teams reached the NCAA tournament ten straight times from 1995 to 2004. Stanford reached the Final Four under Montgomery in 1998, the school's first Final Four appearance in 56 years. He made his third appearance along the USA Basketball sidelines in 2002 when he was named an assistant under George Karl for the US national team in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.[3] Prior to being named head coach at Montana in 1978, he was an assistant for the Griz in Missoula for two seasons under new head coach Jim Brandenburg, who succeeded hall of famer Jud Heathcote in 1976. Brandenburg left after two season for Wyoming in 1978 and Montgomery was promoted.[1] At Montana, Montgomery coached future NBA players Micheal Ray Richardson and Larry Krystkowiak. Prior to Montana, Montgomery was an assistant for three years at Boise State under Bus Connor, and had previously been an assistant for a season each at four different schools. In 2000, Montgomery was named the Naismith and Basketball Times Coach of the Year. He was also named the Pac-10 Coach of the Year four times. Following his career at Stanford, he was awarded the John R. Wooden Legends of Coaching Lifetime Achievement Award. Montgomery left Stanford to become the head coach of the Golden State Warriors on May 21, 2004. He coached the Warriors for two seasons, during each of which the team compiled identical 34-48 records. Montgomery was terminated as Warriors coach on August 29, 2006. On August 30, 2007, Stanford University announced that Montgomery was returning to the university as Assistant to the Athletic Director on a part-time basis. According to the announcement, ""his duties will include fund raising and public relations while also serving as a mentor to Stanford's coaching staff.""[4] On April 4, 2008, Montgomery was named the head coach of the California men's basketball program.[5] In his first season the Golden Bears went 22–10 and made it to the NCAA Tournament, where they lost in the first round to Maryland. On February 27, 2010, Cal defeated Arizona State, 62–46, to clinch at least a tie for the Pacific-10 Conference championship, the first for the school since 1960. On March 6, the Bears defeated Montgomery's former team, Stanford, 71–61, to clinch an undisputed conference championship. Cal was defeated by Washington in the finals of the Pac-10 Tournament, but received a bid to the NCAA Tournament, where they were seeded 8th in the South Region. The Bears advanced to the second round, where they were defeated by eventual National Champion Duke. On March 31, 2014, Montgomery announced his retirement from California.[2] In October 2011, Montgomery revealed that he had recently been diagnosed and treated for bladder cancer. After a surgical procedure was performed, Montgomery declared himself ""cancer-free.[6] On February 18, 2013, Coach Montgomery was reprimanded by the Pac-12 Conference for shoving one of his players in the chest during a game against USC.

He coached several professional basketball teams, including the Sheboygan Red Skins, the Anderson Packers and the Milwaukee Hawks in the 1940s and 1950s. Moore was hired to coach Sheboygan for the 1946–47 season. The Red Skins finished with a 26–18 record and qualified for the National Basketball League (NBL) playoffs, where they were ousted in the first round. In 1947–48, Moore began the season as Sheboygan's head coach, but gave up the duties when the Red Skins obtained player-coach Bobby McDermott, a Hall of Fame guard, from the Chicago American Gears. The Gears players had been distributed among the NBL's teams when Chicago's league, the fledgling Professional Basketball League of America, folded in November 1947 after only three weeks in operation. McDermott coached Sheboygan to a 4–5 record in one month of duty before leaving for the Tri-Cities Blackhawks and handing the reins back to Moore. The Red Skins finished a disappointing 23–37 and missed the playoffs. Moore served as the commissioner of the NBL in its final season.

219,Dick Motta,"September 3, 1931",,"Jordan in Sandy, Utah",Utah State University,1969,1997,25,true,,"""[5, 3, 7, 2, 8]""",/coaches/mottadi99c.html,"John Richard Motta (born September 3, 1931) is an American former basketball coach whose career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) spanned 25 years, and he continues to rank among the NBA's all-time top 10 in coaching victories. After graduating from Utah State Agricultural College in Logan, Motta started coaching at nearby rural southeastern Idaho at Grace, where he taught seventh grade and coached for two years before being drafted in the armed services, then returned.[1] He once said in an interview that winning the state championship (AA) at Grace in 1959 was his greatest thrill as a coach, even topping the NBA championship he won two decades later. Motta coached at Weber State College in Ogden, Utah in the 1960s. Under the direction of Motta and assistant coach Phil Johnson, Weber State won three Big Sky Conference championships (1965, 1966, 1968). (Johnson won all three years he was head coach: 1969, 1970, 1971.) Motta holds the unique distinction of being one of the very few coaches in the NBA who never played either high school, college, or pro basketball. Motta was hired as head coach of the Chicago Bulls in 1968 after a six-year stint at Weber State. He replaced Johnny Kerr, who had led the team to two playoff appearances despite subpar records of 33-48 and 29-53, respectively. Motta coached the team for eight seasons, coaching 656 games, which served as nearly a third of his career games coached (1,952). From 1970 to 1974 he led the Bulls to four consecutive seasons of 50 wins or more, winning the NBA Coach of the Year Award in 1971. However this did not translate to playoff success as the Bulls won just one playoff series (doing so in 1974) in that span. However, they advanced to the Conference Finals in the 1974-75 season, beating the Kansas City Kings to play the Golden State Warriors, who beat them in seven games to advance to the finals, where that team won the NBA Finals that year. The following year, the team went 24-58. He resigned on May 28, 1976. On the same day he left the Bulls, he was hired as head coach of the Washington Bullets. The previous coach had been K. C. Jones, who had led them to a 48-34 record and a loss in the Eastern Conference Semifinals to the Cleveland Cavaliers. In his first season, the Bullets went 48-34 while advancing to the Semifinals again after beating the Cavaliers in the First Round, although they lost to the Houston Rockets in six games. The next year was the pinnacle for the team and Motta's career. They went 44-38, but they advanced all the way to the 1978 NBA Finals, where they beat the Seattle SuperSonics in seven games (with the last game in Seattle) to win the NBA championship. The following year, the team went 54-28 while winning the Atlantic Division. This was not only their sixth division title in eight years, it was also their last division title until 2017. The Bullets went to the 1979 NBA Finals, although they had to fight the full seven games in both the Semifinals and the Conference Finals, nearly blowing a 3-1 series lead to the Atlanta Hawks in the former and having to come back from a 3-1 series deficit from the San Antonio Spurs in the latter. In the Finals that year, they played the Seattle SuperSonics once again. The Bullets won Game 1 at home 99–97, but the SuperSonics won the following four games to win the NBA championship. The following year, the Bullets went 39-43, although they qualified for a playoff berth. They were beaten by the Philadelphia 76ers in two games. He resigned as head coach on May 27, 1980. Motta is sometimes erroneously credited with coining the celebrated phrase: The opera ain't over 'til the fat lady sings.[2] In fact, the first recorded use of the phrase was by Texas Tech sports information director Ralph Carpenter, as reported in the Dallas Morning News on 10 March 1976.[3] During a KENS-TV broadcast of the 1978 NBA Eastern Conference semi-finals between the Washington Bullets and the San Antonio Spurs, Cook used the phrase in an attempt to encourage Spurs fans, as their team was down three games to one against the Bullets. Motta heard the broadcast and adopted his own rendition of the expression — ""The 'opera' isn't over 'til the fat lady sings"" — to warn Bullets fans against braggadocio. The odds were against the underdog Bullets, and sportswriters were forecasting a grim finale, so Motta rebounded with the upbeat ostinato, ""Wait for the fat lady!"" The Bullets won the Eastern Conference against the Atlantic Division Champion Philadelphia 76ers, and went on to beat the Western Conference Champion Seattle SuperSonics four games to three for the 1978 NBA title. The victory gave Washington, D.C. area fans their first professional championship team in any sport since the Washington Redskins won the National Football League title in 1942. (The basketball team played its home games in nearby Landover, Maryland.) In Motta's second year as coach, the Bullets (the Washington ""Wizards"", as of 1997) had become only the third team to win the NBA championship in a seventh game on the road. That 1978 championship remains the franchise's only NBA championship. After the climactic Game 7 victory to claim the title, Motta celebrated with his team wearing a beer-soaked The Opera Isn't Over 'Til The Fat Lady Sings T-shirt. In a Nov. 5, 2003 interview in the Utah Statesman, the student newspaper of his alma mater Utah State University, Motta said opera lovers were angry with him at first. ""My wife said they were going to kill me when I said that."" But that as time passed, Motta said, he was extended friendly invitations to a variety of events with ""operatic"" themes ranging from the Metropolitan Opera in New York to the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. Motta was the first head coach of the Dallas Mavericks, hired by the team on July 16, 1980. His first team went 15-67, dead last in the league. They did not lose as many games again until 1992 when they lost 60 games. Motta's Mavericks gradually rose up in prominence, rising in finishes in the Midwest Division from 6th in the first season to 4th by the third year. His fourth season (1983-84) was the start of something big for the team, as they went 43-39 while qualifying for the playoffs for the first time. They defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in the First Round to advance to the Semifinals, where they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games. In the following year, the Mavs went to the playoffs once again after a 44-38 season, although they lost to the Portland Trail Blazers in the First Round. They went to the Semifinals the following year after a 44-38 year and a beating of the Utah Jazz in the First Round, although it ended with another loss to the Lakers. The next season was Motta's last, and it was his best with the team as they went 55-27 and finished 2nd in the Western Conference, winning their first Midwest Division title (the Mavericks did not win a division title again for twenty seasons). However, they lost to the SuperSonics in the First Round in four games. Motta resigned a month after the season ended on May 20. On January 4, 1990, Motta was hired by the Sacramento Kings in the middle of the season, replacing Jerry Reynolds, who had led the team to a 7-21 record. Motta coached the Kings to a 16-38 record, while the Kings had an ultimate record of 23-59. The next season, the Kings went 25-57 while finishing dead last in the Pacific Division. The same would be true the following year, although Motta was fired after a 7-18 start on Christmas Eve in 1991. On May 17, 1994, Dallas hired him back as coach of the team, replacing Quinn Buckner, who went 13-69. Motta led the team to a 23 game improvement with a 36-46 record. His second and final season went less successful as they went 26-56. He was reassigned from his head coach role on May 1, 1996. The Denver Nuggets hired Motta on November 26, 1996, replacing Bernie Bickerstaff, who had gotten the team to a 4-9 start. The Nuggets went into a tailspin, going 17-52 while losing 26 of their final 30 games to finish 21-61 and 12th in the Western Conference. Motta was fired on April 21, 1997.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/219.png

Mullaney was born on Long Island, New York. After graduating from Chaminade High School in Mineola he played college basketball at Holy Cross and with Bob Cousy was on the team that won the 1947 NCAA Championship. He played briefly for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association. After college, Mullaney was with the FBI before returning to basketball as coach at Norwich University in Vermont. Mullaney became head basketball coach at Providence College in 1955. He coached the Friars from that time until 1969. He returned to Providence as head coach in 1981 and remained there until 1985. Mullaney won 319 games in his 18 seasons at Providence, losing 164 for a career winning percentage there of .660. Mullaney won the 1961 and 1963 National Invitation Tournament championships at Providence. Mullaney also took the Friars to the NIT four other times and into the NCAA tournament three times. His assistant and protégé at Providence, Dave Gavitt, went on to be a successful coach of the Friars in his own right, taking them to the 1973 Final Four and eventually providing the catalyst to the founding of the Big East Conference. Mullaney left Providence in 1969 to coach the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association, succeeding Butch van Breda Kolff who took the Lakers to the NBA Finals that year, losing 4 games to 3 to the Boston Celtics. In the 1969–70 season the Lakers overcame several injury problems and finished 46-36, two games behind the first-place Atlanta Hawks in the Western Division. Wilt Chamberlain was lost to injury early in the season and Elgin Baylor was also lost to injury later; both returned in time for the playoffs. The Lakers were the NBA runner up that year. They defeated the Phoenix Suns in the division semifinals and Atlanta in the division finals. The Lakers lost a tight NBA Championship series 4 games to 3 to the New York Knicks.[2] In the 1970–71 season the Lakers finished 48-34, first in the new Pacific Division. The Lakers defeated the Chicago Bulls in the conference semifinal but lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in the Western Conference Finals.[2] In 1971 Mullaney became the fifth coach of the Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association, succeeding Frank Ramsey in 1971. Mullaney coached the Colonels for two seasons before Babe McCarthy succeeded him for the 1973–74 season.[2][2][3] In the 1971–72 season the talent-laden Colonels finished with a remarkable record of 68-16, the best ever record in the history of the ABA, finishing first in the Eastern Division. Incredibly, the Colonels lost the 1972 Eastern Division Semifinals to the 44-40 New York Nets, 4 games to 2.[4] Mullaney coached the East team to a 142-115 win in the ABA All Star game that season.[2][2][3] In the 1972–73 season the Colonels finished 56-28, good for second place in the Eastern Division. The Colonels beat the Virginia Squires 4 games to 1 in the Eastern Division Semifinals, beat the Carolina Cougars 4 games to 3 in the Eastern Division Finals, and lost the American Basketball Association Championship 4 games to 3 to the Indiana Pacers.[2][3][5] After the 1972–73 season Mullaney left the Colonels to coach the Utah Stars.[3] [6] Mullaney was replaced in Kentucky by Babe McCarthy. Oddly, McCarthy and Mullaney both were named co-ABA Coach of the Year for the 1974–75 season.[2][3][7] In the 1973–74 season Mullaney coached the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Association to a 51-33 record, finishing first in the Western Division. The Stars defeated the San Diego Conquistadors 4 games to 2 in the 1974 Western Division Semifinals and the Indiana Pacers 4 games to 3 in the 1974 Western Division Finals but lost in the 1974 ABA Championship to the New York Nets 4 games to 1. Mullaney coached the West team in the 1974 ABA All-Star Game, losing to the McCarthy-coached East squad 128-112. Mullaney was replaced as coach of the Stars by Morris ""Bucky"" Buckwalter after that single season in Utah.[2][6][8] During the 1974–75 season Mullaney coached the Memphis Sounds of the American Basketball Association.[9] The Sounds finished with a record of 27-57 and in fourth place in the Eastern Division.[10] Their season was ended by Mullaney's old team, the Kentucky Colonels, en route to the Colonels' 1975 ABA Championship.[10][11] At the start of the 1975–1976 season Mullaney was the coach of the Baltimore Claws but the team folded after a few preseason exhibition games and before the start of the regular season.[12] In December 1975 Mullaney became coach of the Spirits of St. Louis. Mullaney took the helm in St. Louis in midseason after the team opened with a record of 20 wins and 27 losses under coach Rod Thorn. Mullaney was the final coach of the Spirits of St. Louis, as at the end of the 1975–1976 season the Spirits, along with the Kentucky Colonels, were the only two ABA teams that did not join the NBA in the ABA–NBA merger.[13] After the 1975–76 season Mullaney coached the Buffalo Braves of the National Basketball Association. Mullaney was brought on board by the Braves' new owner, John Y. Brown Jr., who had previously had an ownership interest in Mullaney's old team, the Kentucky Colonels. Despite Adrian Dantley earning Rookie of the Year the Braves finished in fourth place at 30-52. Mullaney coached in Italy and then for Brown University from 1978 through 1981 before returning to Providence College to coach the program from 1981 to 1985.

221,Bill Musselman,,"May 5, 2000",,,1981,1991,4,true,,"""[6, 1]""",/coaches/mussebi99c.html,"William Clifford Musselman (August 13, 1940 – May 5, 2000) was an American basketball coach in the NCAA, the ABA, the WBA, the CBA and the NBA. He was known for his trademark intensity, once being quoted as saying, ""Defeat is worse than death” because “you have to live with defeat."" Musselman was the second of five children. His father was an auto mechanic. He had a loving and dedicated mother named Bertha who later married James Miller. James became Bill's father and was a big part of his life growing up. The young Musselman played basketball, football, and baseball at Wooster High School in Wooster, Ohio. When he graduated in 1958, he was the school's second all-time leading scorer. After high school, he attended Wittenberg College (now Wittenberg University) in Springfield, Ohio, where he played basketball for Ray Mears, who would later coach the University of Tennessee. In 1963, at the age of 23, Musselman was hired as the head men's basketball coach at Kent State University High School in Kent, Ohio. In Musselman's first season of coaching, the KSUHS Statesmen finished 14-5 and earned a share of the conference title.[1] In 1964, after one season of coaching high school basketball, Musselman was hired to assist with the football and basketball teams at Ashland University in Ashland, Ohio. In August 1965, Ashland's head basketball coach left for another coaching position. With only a few months before the start of the 1965-66 season, Musselman was promoted to head coach. In his first season, at the age of 25, he guided the Eagles to a 10-10 record. Over the next five seasons, Musselman's Ashland teams went 21-3, 24-6, 26-4, 23-4, and 25-3 (total: 109-20, with a .845 winning percentage). While at Ashland, Musselman's teams reached the NCAA College Division Tournament (the predecessor to the current Division II and Division III Tournaments) four times and had 13 All-America players. His 1968-69 Ashland team allowed an NCAA-record-low 33.9 points per game, a byproduct of his relentless pursuit, at the time, of pitching shut-outs (allowing no points) while head coach. Following the 1970-71 season, Musselman left Ashland for the University of Minnesota. In 1971-72, he led the Gophers to an 18-7 record and their first Big Ten Championship in 53 years with a roster featuring Dave Winfield, Jim Brewer, Bobby Nix, Keith Young, Clyde Turner, Corky Taylor, and Ron Behagen. The 1972 team was tarnished by a brawl against The Ohio State Buckeyes, where several Minnesota players assaulted the Ohio State players at the end of the game. The Gophers lost to Florida State in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, 70-56, before rebounding in the Midwest Region Consolation Round, downing Marquette, 77-72. The following season (1972–73), Musselman guided the Gophers to a 21-5 mark. Minnesota began the season ranked fourth in the nation and ranked as high as No. 3 in the country in March 1973. In the 1973 NIT postseason tournament, Musselman's Minnesota team downed Rutgers, 68-59, in the first round before losing to Alabama 69-65 in the quarterfinals. During the 1973-74 campaign, without Brewer, Behagen, or Turner, the Gophers dropped to 12-12 under Musselman. His starting lineup that season featured Flip Saunders, who would go on to have a successful NBA coaching career. In his fourth and final season at Minnesota, Musselman's team went 18-8 and included a roster of future NBA players Mychal Thompson, Mark Landsberger, and Mark Olberding. His overall coaching record at Minnesota is 61-32 with a .656 winning percentage. Musselman's tenure at Minnesota was tainted after an incident during the 1971-72 season when Taylor and Behagen assaulted Ohio State center Luke Witte. The attack on Witte came near the end of the Gophers-Buckeyes game. Witte was seriously injured, taken off the court on a stretcher and hospitalized with injuries, including to an eye, that negatively impacted his basketball career. Two other Ohio State players were also hospitalized as a result of the brawl.[2] Musselman maintained that he had nothing to do with the incident. Still, critics claimed he had stirred his players into a frenzy before the game that night and encouraged overly aggressive play. A September 1, 1985, article in The New York Times described Musselman's Gophers as ""an extremely physical basketball team."" During Musselman's time at the University of Minnesota, home attendance increased from 4,000 per game to nearly 18,000 per game, according to The New York Times. After Musselman left to coach in the American Basketball Association (ABA), the NCAA placed the Gophers on probation after discovering more than 100 rule violations. On July 28, 1975, Musselman left the college ranks to join the pro game when he was hired to coach the San Diego Sails of the American Basketball Association. The team only lasted for 11 games of the 1975-76 season before folding with a 3-8 record. According to the book Obsession, by Bill Heller, Musselman signed a three-year contract worth more than $135,000, considerably more than the $23,000 salary he had received at the University of Minnesota. A week after the ABA's San Diego franchise folded on November 11, 1975, Musselman was hired to coach the league's Virginia Squires. Musselman took over for player-coach Mack Calvin, who had gone 0-6 since taking over for Al Bianchi. During one game, Musselman played his starters the entire 48 minutes, according to The New York Times. Musselman went 4-22 with the Squires before he was replaced by Jack Ankerson on January 21, 1976. Ankerson, who would go on to serve as general manager of the San Antonio Spurs, went 1-1 as coach of the Squires before being replaced by Zelmo Beaty, who compiled a 9-33 record. The Squires went 15-68 on the season and disbanded on May 10, 1976. In the book Obsession, by Bill Heller, Musselman said, ""I found the players [in Virginia] were talking more about the [team's] financial troubles than basketball. They worried more about the next payroll than they did about the next practice. It was difficult for them to concentrate on basketball."" Musselman took two years away from coaching to work in real estate before returning in 1978-79 to coach the Reno Bighorns of the Western Basketball Association. That season he led the club to a 28-20 record and the only WBA title game. Led by Randy Ayers and Gus Bailey, Reno lost to Herb Brown's Tucson Gunners, four games to three, in the 1979 championship. The league folded soon after. Ted Stepien, then owner of the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers, hired Musselman for his first NBA head coaching job in 1980. Musselman guided the team to a 25-46 mark before he was replaced by general manager Don Delaney, who went 3-8 to close out the 1980-81 season. On March 8, 1982, Stepien fired Chuck Daly, who was 9-32 as coach of the Cavs, and replaced him on an interim basis with Musselman, then the team's director of player personnel. The Cavs went 2-21 under Musselman, who finished the season as head coach, his second stint at the helm. Musselman resigned on October 21, 1982, just a few days before the start of the 1982-83 NBA season. In an April 17, 1994 New York Times article, former NBA center Cedric Maxwell said the Cavs' veteran players during that time ""were known more for partying than for playing."" Musselman's foray into minor league basketball began in 1983 when he was hired to coach the Sarasota (Fla.) Stingers of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). Just 19 games into the season, sporting a 6-13 record, Musselman was fired. The team fared no better after Musselman's firing, finishing the season with a 16-28 record. The following season, Musselman moved a few miles up the Florida Gulf Coast to St. Petersburg where he was hired to coach the expansion Tampa Bay Thrillers of the CBA. There, over the next three seasons, Musselman would build one of the winningest franchises in sports history. As an expansion team, his 1984-85 Thrillers team rolled to a 45-18 record to win the CBA title, downing the Detroit Spirits in seven games. Tampa Bay repeated as CBA champions the following season going 46-19 and defeating the LaCrosse (Wisc.) Catbirds in five games, 4-1. The ""three-peat"" followed in 1986-87 in Rapid City, South Dakota, where the team had moved at the conclusion of the regular season. The Thrillers, who went 46-16 overall, lost the first game of the finals to the Rockford (Ill.) Lightning, before winning four consecutive games as Musselman won his third consecutive CBA championship. For his efforts, Musselman was honored as CBA Coach of the Year. Among the players starring for Musselman's Thriller teams were Sidney Lowe, Clinton Wheeler, Rod Higgins, Freeman Williams, Sam Mitchell, Ed Nealy, Steve Hayes, Brian Martin, Eddie Johnson, Don Collins, Ron Valentine, Perry Moss, Kevin Williams, and Charles Jones. On June 19, 1987, Musselman jumped to the Albany (NY) Patroons for the 1987-88 CBA season, guiding the Pats to a remarkable 48-6 record and his fourth consecutive league title. Albany's roster featured Tony Campbell, Michael Brooks, Sidney Lowe, Michael Ray Richardson, Scott Roth, Reid Gettys, Tod Murphy, Eric Fernsten, Derrick Rowland, Scott Brooks, and Lowes Moore. Musselman was named CBA Coach of the Year for the second time following the 1987-88 season. Following his success in the CBA, on August 23, 1988, Musselman was hired as the head coach of the expansion Minnesota Timberwolves. With a roster ""full of vagabonds, long shots and characters,"" according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Musselman's Wolves posted a 22-60 record in 1989-90, their first season, and 29-53 the following season. Musselman was fired on April 22, 1991, a day after the 1990–91 season ended. But the 29 wins under Musselman were a high-water mark for the T-wolves, who failed to top 29 wins until 1996-97. Musselman's expansion team won more games than any of the four expansion teams and more in his second season (29) than any expansion team since the 1974-75 New Orleans Jazz. In a March 29, 2007, Minneapolis Star Tribune article by Steve Aschburner, Pooh Richardson, a member of the expansion Timberwolves, said: ""We were the best expansion team out there. That was as good as going to the playoffs. That's one thing that Musselman always gave us: a chance to win. Pass the ball, pass the ball, cut down the shots for the other team."" Musselman highlighted his style of doggedly exploiting the other team's weaknesses when on a February 4, 1990 game against the Golden State Warriors, he called the same play all game in an attempt to get coach Don Nelson to double-team journeyman big man Randy Breuer in his matchup against lighter defenders Manute Bol and Jim Petersen in order to free up guards Pooh Richardson and Tony Campbell.[3] Although the Wolves lost the game 106-96, it resulted in Breuer scoring a career high 40 points.[4] On July 22, 1993, Musselman returned to the CBA for the 1993-94 season, this time in an attempt to revive the Rochester Renegade, a struggling franchise that had gone 6-50 the previous season. Rochester finished 31-25 under Musselman, a 25-win improvement. Musselman's roster included Rodney Monroe, Ronnie Grandison, Clinton Wheeler, Dave Jamerson, Brook Steppe, Tod Murphy, and Ralph McPherson. The team folded following the season. In March 1995, Musselman returned to the NCAA after a 25-year absence with the University of South Alabama. In two seasons, he led the Jaguars to the 1997 NCAA tournament after turning the program around from a 9-18 record. Musselman's 1997 South Alabama team went 23-7 and nearly upset eventual champion Arizona in the opening round of the NCAA tournament. Musselman resigned as coach of the Jags on October 7, 1997, to return to the NBA. The following season, a South Alabama team made up mainly of Musselman recruits also advanced to the NCAA Tournament first round and lost to Illinois under then-head coach Bob Weltlich. On October 8, 1997, after two successful seasons as head coach at the University of South Alabama, Musselman returned to the NBA as an assistant with the Portland Trail Blazers, under Mike Dunleavy Sr. This marked the first time in his professional coaching career that he served as an assistant. Musselman served as an assistant for three seasons with the Blazers before his death in May 2000. While coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Musselman, whom The New York Times once described as ""hot tempered,"" was criticized for his ""disciplinary tactics,"" according to the Times. During his stint as coach of the ABA's Virginia Squires, Musselman ""antagonized so-called problem players...and docile ones,"" according to a January 3, 1981, article in the New York Times. Musselman claimed ""the only time I yell is before a game and at halftime,"" explaining that his passion helps players give ""maximum effort every second."" NBA coach Flip Saunders was quoted in the St. Paul Pioneer Press the day after Musselman died. Of Musselman, Saunders said, ""In anything he did, he had great passion."" In Charley Walters' December 23, 2012, column in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Oklahoma City Thunder head coach Scott Brooks is quoted as saying, ""One of the things I've taken from [Bill Musselman] is doing it every day, being consistent and never changing -- always stick with what you do. He was a creature of habit. He drove the same way to get to practice, the same way to get to the airport. Our practices were so consistent. I wouldn't be in my position today if he hadn't taken me on as a CBA player. He taught me the ropes, how to play with toughness. There were no excuses with him -- you had to play hard every night."" According to former CBA coach Charley Rosen, Musselman possessed an ""admirable sense of fairness."" In an ESPN.com article,[5] Rosen describes a scene after a game between Rosen's CBA team and Musselman's Tampa Bay club: ""We were involved in a tight game at Tampa Bay. Late in the fourth quarter, one of the refs called three charging fouls on my best player, Cedric Henderson, and the Thrillers eventually won on a buzzer-beating shot by the late 'Fast' Eddie Johnson. Instead of celebrating his victory, Bill followed the refs off the court to their locker room, screaming that they had 'screwed Charley out of the win.' He continued to kick and pound his fists on the closed locker room door, raging for another 10 minutes. 'If I can't win a game fairly, then I'd rather lose.'"" In the newspaper articles and columns following his death, Musselman was described as ""volatile,"" ""colorful,"" ""intense,"" and ""fiery."" Sidney Lowe, who played for Musselman in the CBA and NBA, said his former coach was ""very demanding... but he was an excellent coach."" In an Associated Press story that day after Musselman died, Greg Anthony, a guard for the Portland Trail Blazers, described Musselman as ""a great, great man."" In a May 8, 2000, letter to the editor of The Minnesota Daily, the newspaper of the University of Minnesota, Dr. R. Galen Hanson wrote, ""By far – far and away – the memories I will always have of coach Bill Musselman is that he is one of the most unforgettable people I have ever met: winner, writer, teacher, coach. Always."" A number of Musselman's former assistant coaches and players went on to coach in the NBA, including Sidney Lowe (Minnesota Timberwolves), Tyrone Corbin (Utah Jazz), Tom Thibodeau (Minnesota Timberwolves), Scott Brooks (Oklahoma City Thunder), Sam Mitchell (Toronto Raptors), and his son Eric Musselman (Sacramento Kings and Golden State Warriors). Other coaches who played for Musselman include Flip Saunders, Scott Roth, Michael Ray Richardson, and Tod Murphy (Gordon College) Musselman suffered a stroke on October 30, 1999, following Portland's preseason game against the Phoenix Suns. Musselman, who had served as head coach during the game after Mike Dunleavy was ejected, collapsed after leaving the arena. In April 2000, he was diagnosed with primary systemic amyloidosis, a disease that produces an abnormal protein that collects in tissues and interferes with the function of organs. He died on May 5, 2000, at 2:45 a.m., at the age of 59, at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The cause of death was heart and kidney failure. The Trail Blazers used Musselman as an inspiration for their 2000 playoff run, which ended in the Western Conference finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. In the team's 2000-01 media guide, which was dedicated to Musselman, he was described as ""a keen strategist and an inspiring motivator."" Musselman has three children: two sons and a daughter. His oldest son Eric, formerly head coach of the Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings, is currently the head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks men’s basketball team. They are the first father and son to hold the title of NBA head coach.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/221.png
222,Eric Musselman,,,,,2003,2007,3,true,,"""[1, 2]""",/coaches/musseer99c.html,"Eric Patrick Musselman (born November 19, 1964) is an American college basketball coach who is the current head men's basketball coach at the University of Arkansas. He is the former head coach of the Sacramento Kings and Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Between head coaching stints at Golden State and Sacramento, Musselman served as an assistant for the Memphis Grizzlies under Mike Fratello. He moved to the college coaching ranks in 2012 as an assistant at Arizona State. From 2014-19, he was the head coach for Nevada. The son of former NBA head coach Bill Musselman, Eric Musselman was a head coach in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) before becoming an assistant coach with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Orlando Magic (under Chuck Daly and Doc Rivers), and Atlanta Hawks (under Lon Kruger). Musselman grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and San Diego, California, before moving to suburban Cleveland, Ohio, where he attended Brecksville-Broadview Heights High School in Brecksville, a suburb about 15 miles south of Cleveland. There, he played on the same high school basketball team as former NBA player Scott Roth and former NFL Pro Bowl punter/quarterback Tom Tupa. Musselman graduated from the University of San Diego, where he played basketball for Jim Brovelli and Hank Egan, both of whom would later work as NBA assistants. While Musselman was at USD (1983–87), the Toreros compiled a 77-36 record. He was a member of the 1986–87 team that compiled a 24–6 record, the best in school history. The Toreros lost to Auburn University in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, 62–61. Among Musselman's teammates at USD were Scott Thompson, a 7-foot center who was drafted in the fourth round by the Washington Bullets in the 1987 NBA Draft, and Mike Whitmarsh, who won a silver medal in beach volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Musselman was a fifth-round CBA draft choice of the Albany Patroons in 1987. In the CBA, Musselman posted a 270–122 record (.688), marking the second highest winning percentage in league history behind George Karl, who coached for five seasons in the CBA. Musselman began his CBA career in 1988 as the general manager of the Rapid City Thrillers, a franchise his father Bill had coached to three consecutive CBA titles during the 1980s. His first week on the job, he hired Flip Saunders as the team's head coach. Saunders, who was recruited by Bill Musselman when Bill was the head coach at the University of Minnesota during the early 1970s, would go on to be one of the winningest coaches in CBA history before moving to the NBA as coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves.[1] In the 1989–90 season, at age 23, Musselman became the Thrillers head coach.[1] The following season, Musselman joined his father Bill's staff on the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves as assistant coach.[2] Prior to joining the Thrillers, Musselman worked for the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers as an assistant to General Manager Elgin Baylor and Barry Hecker, the team's director of scouting. From 1990–1997, Musselman had 24 players called up to the NBA, the highest number in the league during that span. He holds the distinction of being the only person in CBA history to coach in five league All-Star Games (1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997) and was the first coach in professional basketball history to win 100 games by the age of 28. When he was 23, Musselman became the youngest coach in CBA history. Musselman also served as head coach of the Florida Sharks of the United States Basketball League (USBL). In the summers of 1995 and 1996, he coached the Sharks to a combined 53–3 record (.946, including playoffs) and back-to-back USBL Championships. He holds the highest winning percentage in league history. Musselman was an assistant coach for the Orlando Magic from 1998 to 2000 under Chuck Daly and Doc Rivers who would go on to be named NBA Coach of the Year in the 1999-00 season, then also for the Atlanta Hawks from 2000 to 2002 under Lon Kruger.[2] In 2002, Musselman was named the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, a position he held for two years. He finished as runner-up to San Antonio's Gregg Popovich in NBA Coach of the Year Award voting in 2002–2003 with 231 points, including 26 first-place votes.[3] That season, under Musselman's guidance, the Warriors, for the first time in nearly a decade, reached the .500 mark late in the season, holding a record of 30–30 on March 4, 2003. In Musselman's rookie season, his club finished 38–44, the most wins in more than 10 years. Despite numerous injuries and the loss of the team's top two players in Gilbert Arenas (signed with Washington) and Antawn Jamison (traded to Dallas), the team still finished 37–45 under his direction during the 2003–2004 season. In two seasons as head coach in Golden State, Musselman compiled a 75–89 record. Nevertheless, he was let go after the 2004 season ended when Chris Mullin took over as the team's general manager. Musselman's .457 winning percentage with Golden State ranks 10th all-time among Warriors coaches, behind Steve Kerr (.801 through 2017-2018), Neil Johnson (.617), Frank McGuire (.613), George Senesky (.551), Bill Sharman (.534), Al Attles (.518), Don Nelson (.487), Mark Jackson (.473) and George Lee (.470). After his two seasons as head coach of the Golden State Warriors, Musselman was an assistant coach for the Memphis Grizzlies under Mike Fratello from 2004 to 2006.[2] On June 2, 2006, Musselman was named head coach of the Sacramento Kings, replacing Rick Adelman. Four months into the job, on October 21, 2006, Musselman was cited for DUI in Sacramento.[4] According to experts, Musselman, who is 5-foot-7 and weighs 150 pounds, was ""one or two drinks over"" the legal limit.[5] At the time, Musselman said, ""Alcohol has never been a big part of my life. I don't allow it in my house. My sons have never seen me take a sip of anything."" According to Ailine Voisin, a sports columnist for The Sacramento Bee, ""[Musselman] drinks so infrequently, in fact, that he can count the number of beers he consumes per month.""[6] In the first month of the season (November 2006) with Musselman at the helm, the Kings went 8–5. But the team slumped in December and January, posting a 10–21 record before going 7–6 in February 2007. The Kings finished 33–49 on the season. Musselman was fired by Sacramento President of Basketball Operations Geoff Petrie on April 20, 2007.[7] Musselman's .402 winning percentage with Sacramento ranks fourth all-time among Kings coaches, behind Rick Adelman (.633), Reggie Theus (.415) and Garry St. Jean (.403). On August 11, 2010, Musselman was named head coach of the NBA Development League's Reno Bighorns. Despite several players being called up to the NBA, including Marcus Landry and Jeremy Lin, the Bighorns finished 34–16 and first in the D-League Western Conference.[8][9] Musselman was named head coach of the Los Angeles D-Fenders on August 18, 2011. Sports Illustrated called Musselman one of the ""best teachers"" in the D-League.[10] During the 2011–12 season, he guided the team to a 38-12 record, the best mark in league history. The D-Fenders, who finished with the best defensive FG percentage in the league, advanced to the D-League finals before losing to the Austin Toros, in a three-game series. In April 2012, Musselman was named the 2011–12 D-League Coach of the Year.[11] A month later, in May 2012, the D-Fenders were named the 2011–12 NBA D-League Development Champion, which recognizes ""the team that best embodies the NBA D-League's goals of developing NBA basketball talent via call-ups and assignments.""[12] Under Herb Sendek, Musselman was assistant coach at Arizona State in the 2012–13 season, then was promoted to associate head coach in 2013.[9] In two seasons with the Sun Devils, Musselman helped ASU to the NIT Tournament in 2013 and the NCAA Tournament in 2014. The team went 21-12 in both seasons. In June 2014, Musselman became associate head coach at LSU under Johnny Jones.[9] In Musselman's one season with the Tigers, LSU went 22-10 and reached the NCAA Tournament, losing to North Carolina State, 66-65, in the first round.[13] On March 25, 2015, the University of Nevada, Reno hired Musselman as head coach for the Nevada Wolf Pack men's basketball team.[14] In early March 2016, Bleacher Report named Musselman the Mountain West Coach of the Year after guiding the Wolf Pack to an 18-12 record, a 9-win improvement over the previous season.[15] The team's winning percentage jumped from 31 to 60, which ranked as the 11th best improvement nationally.[16] Following the 2015–16 season, Nevada was invited to play in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI), winning its first three games to improve its season record to 21-12 and advance to the CBI championship series vs Morehead State.[17] According to Chris Murray, a reporter who covered the team for the Reno Gazette Journal, ""No coach in Nevada basketball history has done a better job of getting everything out of the talent on the roster. It might be the best coaching job in Wolf Pack hoops history.""[18] Nevada's 2016 recruiting class was ranked as the 35th best in the nation by 247Sports.[19] Musselman's 2016-17 Wolf Pack team went 14-4 in conference play to win the Mountain West regular season title. The team also won the 2017 MWC postseason tournament championship to earn a bid in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. Nevada finished 28-7 overall for the season, tied for the second-most wins in school history. In December 2017, Musselman's Nevada team was voted to the nation's top 25, the first time since 2007 that the Wolf Pack had ranked among the top 25 teams nationally.[20] Musselman was named 2017-18 Mountain West Coach of the Year after guiding the Wolf Pack to a 15-3 conference record and the MWC regular season title. He was also named the Coach of the Year for District 17 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches.[21] The team set a school record for most wins in a season.[22] In March 2018, Nevada was announced as an at-large selection for the NCAA men's basketball tournament as a seventh seed.[23] In their first round game, the Wolf Pack came back from 14 points down to defeat Texas, 87-83. In Round 2, Nevada rallied from a 22-point deficit to upset second-seeded Cincinnati, 75-73, propelling the Wolf Pack to its second Sweet 16 appearance in school history.[24] During the 2017-18 season, Nevada finished 12-3 in true road games. Those 12 victories were a single-season school record and tied for most in the country. On September 5, 2018, the Nevada athletics department announced today season tickets for the upcoming men's basketball season were officially sold out.[25] To start the 2018-19 season, Nevada was ranked #7 in the preseason Associated Press poll and #9 in the USA Today Coaches Poll. It is the highest ranking in school history for the Wolf Pack. The previous top ranking was #9 on Feb. 26, 2007. Additionally, the #7 ranking was the highest preseason ranking in Mountain West Conference history. The Nevada Wolf Pack finished the year ranked in the Associated Press Top 25 all 20 weeks of the college basketball season, with the highest ranking in school ranking coming in week 4 with a #5 AP ranking. On November 6, Nevada opened the season with an 86-70 victory over BYU. Caroline scored a game-high 25 points, with 21 coming in the second half. Nevada opened the season with the only starting lineup in college basketball consisting of all fifth-year seniors. On November 27, the wolf pack avenge their Sweet 16 loss in March to Loyola-Chicago by defeating Loyola, 79-65, in Chicago. The Pack, now ranked No. 5 in the country, was led by Caleb Martin (21 points) and Cody Martin (20 points). A week later, Nevada rallied in the 2nd half to defeat #20 Arizona State 72-66 in the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. In front of the 12th-largest crowd in Lawlor Events Center History, the Wolf Pack honored its Seniors beating San Diego State 81-53, and earning its third straight Mountain West Conference Regular Season title. The Pack became the third team in Mountain West Conference history to win three straight regular season conference titles.[26] Nevada's 2018-19 season shattered the all-time attendance record at Lawlor Events Center. The season total of 163,169 broke the former record set in 2005-06 of 150,674, and doing it in 3 less games. Additionally, the average home game attendance of 10,878, broke the record set previous year (2017–18), of 9,048.[27] Musselman joined Mark Few (Gonzaga), Dave Rose (BYU), Steve Fisher (SDSU), Steve Alford (New Mexico), and Shaka Smart (VCU), as recent mid-major coaches with four-year spans of 25+ wins per season, 3+ tournament appearances, 2+ tournament wins, and at least one week in AP Top 10. After finishing the year with an overall record of 29-5, Musselman received one vote for AP Coach of the Year (tied 11th). Musselman was named Arkansas head coach on April 7, 2019.[28] His team got off to an 8-0 start heading into December, the school's best start to a season since the 1997-98 season. The Razorbacks went 11-1 in non-conference play going in to their conference schedule. They finished non-conference play with a 71 - 64 win on the road at Indiana University. Arkansas defeated TCU 78- 67 at home in the mid season SEC vs Big 12 Challenge. The win making Arkansas 12-1 in non-conf play. Arkansas at that point had gone 3-3 in SEC play with wins over Vandy and Texas A&M at home, and Ole Miss on the road. Losses were to LSU and MSU on the road, and a loss at home to Kentucky. Musselman in his first year at Arkansas recruited the fifth ranked recruiting class according to ESPN.com. On his blog, Musselman wrote about the importance of matching an offense to the ""team's make up."" Depending on the roster, a half-court offense might make more sense. In other cases, a team may be better suited for an ""open offense."" According to Musselman, the idea is to allow players to ""play to their strengths.""[29] As head coach of the Golden State Warriors, Musselman would often use ""three-guard rotations to create mismatches and fast-break opportunities for his club.""[30] As head coach of the Venezuela National Team, Musselman said his team's identity was that of a ""fast-paced, up-tempo team.""[31] According to former NBA coach Jeff Van Gundy, Musselman is ""as competitive of a guy as I've ever coached against. He's a brilliant offensive mind.""[32] According to University of Kentucky head coach John Calipari, ""Eric is one of the best in our sport. Extremely driven and knowledgeable. I've watched and coached against him in the NBA and FIBA games. He has an uncanny feel for the game, and ability to read where the game is at. More importantly, is his ability to motivate and teach his players what it takes to improve and win. He is as good as it gets.""[33] In an August 2011 interview on NBA.com, Musselman said that, as a coach, ""you have to continually figure out a way to get your players better.""[34] According to Gerald Green, who played for Musselman with the D-League's Los Angeles D-Fenders in 2012, Musselman ""did a hell of a job really motivating me, really pushing me every day in practice when I was with L.A. I have to give him credit [for improving my game].""[35] Green said that Musselman ""rode me about staying focused. Don’t take even a second off of any play. Don’t take any plays off. Don’t take practice for granted.""[36] Like Green, Jeremy Lin has also credited Musselman with aiding his development. In February 2012, Lin said that when he played for Musselman in the D-League, ""he gave me the opportunity to play through mistakes.""[37] Gregory Echenique, who played for Musselman on the Venezuela National Team in 2011, said Musselman ""had the most energy of any coach I've ever been around. He had a problem with his Achilles, and he would throw his crutches down and literally crawl to get after you. From the first day we met him to when we left him, his intensity never changed. It didn't matter who you were — he was in your face if he needed to be. At the same time, he was so positive. He always believed we could win. He was the guy that put the fire into us.""[38] Kevin Martin (basketball), who played for Musselman with the Sacramento Kings in 2006–07, told NBA.com that Musselman helped him learn how to draw more fouls. According to Martin, Musselman ""saw how teams were playing me and how they got up into me and told me to start absorbing that contact. He said I could score a lot more points in this league if I got to the free throw line. He put an emphasis on me night in night out with that part of the game. He was always pounding it into me and it paid off.""[39] In a May 9, 2013, article by CBSSports.com college basketball writer Gary Parrish, Arizona State guard Jahii Carson credited Musselman with helping him develop as a player. ""Coach Muss is a great guy with a lot of knowledge because he's coached a lot of great players"", said Carson. ""He's given me a lot of great advice … about what NBA people are looking for, about how NBA guys don't take days off, how they're always in the gym doing conditioning or something, always trying to better their games. A guy like me? I didn't know anything like that having never been around the NBA game. So, he's somebody who has helped me.""[40] During the 2013–14 season, Musselman worked with Arizona State center Jordan Bachynski, helping the 7-foot-2 senior with his footwork.[41] After the season, Bachynski earned Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year honors.[42] In October 2007, ESPN reported that Musselman had a desire to coach at the collegiate level. According to Andy Katz, senior college basketball writer for ESPN.com, ""Musselman wants to coach in college and is starting the process of getting his name out among search committees so that he's a viable candidate in March.""[43] In late December 2007, FOX Sports reported that Musselman was a likely candidate to replace 71-year-old Eddie Sutton at the University of San Francisco after this season.[44] In January 2008, his name surfaced in press reports surrounding the head coaching position at Oregon State.[45] In March 2008, Musselman's name surfaced in published reports about the California and Loyola Marymount head coaching positions.[46] On August 30, 2012, Andy Katz reported on ESPN.com's College Basketball Nation Blog that Arizona State University was in talks to hire Musselman as an assistant coach on Herb Sendek's staff.[47] On September 2, 2012, Katz confirmed Musselman's hiring, describing it as a ""bold move"" and a ""coup"" for Sendek.[48] Former NBA coach Jeff Van Gundy predicted that Musselman will be an excellent recruiter ""because of his competitive nature and what he has to sell. This is a guy who can tell kids exactly what it takes to play in the NBA.""[49] Fifteen games into Arizona State's 2012–13 season, ESPN's Andy Katz wrote that ""It's hard to ignore the difference [guard Jahii] Carson and assistant coach Eric Musselman are making at Arizona State."" According to Katz, ""The Sun Devils were painful to watch last season. Now, ASU has multiple options and while it still grinds out wins...""[50] On January 9, 2013, ESPN's Jason King wrote that ""adding former NBA head coach Eric Musselman...to his staff has also been a huge plus for Sendek and his players."" Quoted in King's story, Arizona State center Jordan Bachynski said, ""When [Musselman and Greer] speak, guys listen, just because they have that credibility from being in the league. The way they approach the game … it's no BS. They say, 'This is how it's done. If you don't like it, you're not going to play.'""[51] In a radio interview after the 2012–13 season, Arizona State athletic director Steve Patterson said, ""I think Eric's going to have opportunities to look at head coaching jobs. He's a very qualified coach. He did a great job, I think, teaching and working here.""[52] In a March 26, 2013, post on the ESPN Los Angeles UCLA blog, Peter Yoon described Musselman as one of the ""best under-the-radar candidates out there.""[53] In May 2013, he was promoted to associate head coach.[54] Musselman resigned from Sendek's staff in April 2014.[55] Following the 2013–14 season, Musselman was a candidate for the head coaching position at the University of California, Berkeley,[56] the University of South Florida[57] and Oregon State University.[58] In July 2009, Musselman reportedly turned down an offer to coach Spartak St. Petersburg in Russia.[59] On May 19, 2010, Musselman was named head coach of the Dominican Republic national basketball team.[60] At the 2010 Men's Centro Basketball Championship in July 2010, FIBA Americas' top regional tournament, Musselman guided the Dominican Republic team to the Gold Medal game, losing to Puerto Rico, 89-80, the team's only loss of the tournament (5-1). By finishing second at the Centro Basketball Championship, the Dominican Republic qualifies for the 2011 FIBA Americas Championship, a qualifying tournament for the FIBA World Championships and the Olympic Games.[61] In August 2010, Musselman coached the U.S. 2011 team to the gold medal at the Adidas Global Experience in Chicago. The 2011 team is composed of the top high school seniors in the U.S. The tournament featured the world's top 18-and-under players from five regions of the world: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the United States. Musselman was the head coach of Team China at the 2009 Adidas Nations camp/tournament in Beijing, China. In May 2011, the FIBA World Championship website reported that Musselman had interviewed for the head coaching position of the Puerto Rico men's national basketball team.[62] Earlier that month, he was mentioned as a candidate for the Venezuela national basketball team.[63] On June 15, 2011, Musselman was named head coach of the Venezuela national basketball team.[64] Under Musselman, Venezuela qualified for the 2012 World Pre-Olympic Qualifier by going 4-4 at the FIBA Americas 2011 Pre-Olympic Qualifier in Mar del Plata, Argentina. Venezuela was the top-scoring team in the tournament, averaging 94.8 points per game, 9 points more than the second highest-scoring team. Venezuela went 8-5 in international exhibition games (""friendlies"") leading up to the tournament.[65] Musselman guided Venezuela to a runner-up (silver) finish at the 2012 FIBA Men's South American Championship, posting a 3-2 record. With the second-place finish, Venezuela advanced to the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship, qualifier to the 2014 FIBA World Championship.[66] The team went 1-1 in the 2012 FIBA Olympic qualifying tournament, defeating the Nigeria national team, the team that ultimately advanced to the 2012 Summer Olympics. Venezuela was also 3-1 in friendly games and won the 2012 Super 4 in Puerto la Cruz, Venezuela. According to a December 30, 2009, report by Adrian Wojnarowski, the NBA columnist for Yahoo! Sports, Chicago Bulls General Manager Gar Forman ""was on the phone asking about exiled NBA coach Eric Musselman.""[67] In June 2010, Musselman reportedly interviewed with Avery Johnson for a position on Johnson's staff with the New Jersey Nets.[68] That same month, Musselman was reported to be among the assistant coaching candidates for Tom Thibodeau's staff with the Chicago Bulls.[69] He was reportedly a finalist for Doc Rivers' coaching staff with the Boston Celtics in July 2010.[70] In May 2014, there were reports that Musselman was a candidate for the head coaching position with the Memphis Grizzlies.[71] He was also reported to be a candidate for Flip Saunders' staff with the Minnesota Timberwolves in June 2014.[72] From 2008 to 2010, he served as an NBA analyst for FOX Sports Radio and Clear Channel Radio, and as a color commentator for college basketball games on the regional sports network Comcast SportsNet California and for NBA Development League games on Versus.

It features more than 1,200 posts about coaching and leadership. His last post was on March 20, 2009. Several of the posts from Musselman's blog were reposted on The Fifth Down, the New York Times' NFL blog.[73] Musselman and his wife Danyelle Sargent, a former on-air personality and anchor for ESPN, FOX Sports, and the NFL Network, have a daughter together. Musselman has two sons from a previous marriage. Michael currently serves as the Director of Recruiting for University of Arkansas' Men's Basketball team. Matthew attends the University of San Diego. They live in Fayetteville, Arkansas.[74] Musselman's sister, Nicole, is a fashion designer in Dallas, Texas.[75]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/222.png

225,Don Nelson,"May 15, 1940",,"Rock Island in Rock Island, Illinois",Iowa,1977,2010,31,true,,"""[1, 1, 2, 7]""",/coaches/nelsodo01c.html,"Donald Arvid Nelson (born May 15, 1940), sometimes known as Nellie, is an American former National Basketball Association (NBA) player[1] and head coach. Nelson has the most wins of any coach in NBA history, with 1,335. He coached the Milwaukee Bucks, the New York Knicks, the Dallas Mavericks, and the Golden State Warriors. After an All-American career at the University of Iowa, Nelson won five NBA Championships playing with the Boston Celtics, with his number 19 retired by the franchise. His unique brand of basketball is often referred to as Nellie Ball. A coaching innovator, Nelson is credited with, among other things, pioneering the concept of the point forward, a tactic which is frequently employed by teams at every level today. He was named one of the Top 10 coaches in NBA history. On April 7, 2010, he passed Lenny Wilkens for first place on the all-time NBA wins list with his 1,333rd win.[2] His all-time record coaching record was 1,335–1,063 (.557). Nelson was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012.[3] The son of Arvid and Agnes Nelson, Don Nelson grew up with his family and two sisters on his grandfather’s rural Illinois farm near Sherrard, Illinois. He first learned basketball shooting in the chicken yard where a spokeless bicycle wheel was nailed to the shed to make a basket. Nelson attended a one-room, six-grade, seven-student school. When his family lost the farm, the Nelsons moved to nearby Rock Island, Illinois while in middle school. His father Arvid eventually worked at the Rock Island Arsenal.[4][5] Nelson played in high school at Rock Island High School, in Rock Island, one of the Quad Cities. Nelson lived in downtown Rock Island on 19th street and would walk to school, stopping to shoot baskets at several different locations along the way. Nelson would go to the YMCA after practice and shoot more.[6][7] Graduating in 1958, Nelson led the Rocks to a 47-7 record in his last two years under coach Bob Riley. He had 39 points and 20 rebounds against Moline High School and 30 points and 29 rebounds against No. 1-ranked Ottawa High School. As a junior, Nelson averaged 12.6 points as Rock Island finished 25-3. As a senior, Nelson averaged to 20.2 points, leading the Rocks to a 22-4 record in 1957-58.[8][9] After his senior year in high school, Nelson wasn't heavily recruited. His father did not see a future for Don in basketball and wanted him to become a watch repairman. University of Iowa Coach Sharm Scheuerman, who had graduated from Rock Island in 1952, recruited Nelson, who ultimately chose the Hawkeyes over Wheaton College and Nelson's hometown Augustana College.[10][5] As a 6'6"" sophomore under Coach Schuerman at Iowa, Nelson averaged a double-double of 15.8 points and 10.0 rebounds, as Iowa finished 14-10 in 1959-1960.[11] In the era when NCAA freshman weren't allowed to play varsity, Nelson was joined on the Iowa campus by future Hall of Famer Connie Hawkins in 1960. However, after playing for the freshman Iowa team in 1960-1961, Hawkins was embroiled in the 1961 college basketball gambling scandal and left Iowa. Hawkins was never charged with a crime and was later reinstated by the NBA, who had banned him.[12] ""If Connie had stayed, we would have had a great team,"" Nelson said. ""I feel we could have edged out Ohio State my junior and senior years.""[10] In 1960-1961, Nelson averaged 23.8 points and 10.6 rebounds at Iowa finished second in the Big Ten Conference with an 18-6 record. A mass academic eligibility issue hit the team, as the other four starters were declared academically ineligible at semester, leaving Nelson as the only starter remaining. With Nelson carrying the team, Iowa rallied around him and finished 2nd in the Big 10.[13][10] As a senior in 1961-1962, Nelson avaraged 23.8 points and 11.9 rebounds as the Hawkeyes finished 13-11.[14] In Nelson's years at Iowa, the Big Ten conference was full of future NBA players. Among others, Ohio State had future Hall of Fame players in John Havlicek and Jerry Lucas, along with Larry Siegfried. Indiana had a future Hall of Fame inductee in Walt Bellamy, while Purdue had future NBA All-Star Terry Dischinger. ""It was a terrific training ground for the pros,"" Nelson said. ""So many of them became stars.""[10] ""It's an overused phrase, but the tougher the game got, the tougher Don played,"" Scheuerman said of Nelson. ""He always had a lot of savvy. Don did some things you just can't coach. Some players have the body, but aren't mentally tough. Others are mentally tough, but don't have the body. Don had both.""[10] ""I felt more responsibility and my teammates expected me to carry a bigger portion of the load,"" Nelson said of his Iowa career. ""I still look back at that time as one of the highlights of my whole career. Sharm did a terrific job coaching and we played some terrific basketball.""[10] “What I remember most about it is playing for Sharm and our relationship over 50 years and how close we were and how much I loved that man,” Nelson reflected in 2012 of Scheuerman, who died in 2010. “A role model certainly, but I could never duplicate that man’s life because he was so special. I certainly tried. I’m certainly a better person just by knowing him and talking to him. But we spent a lot of time together over the last 50 years.”[15] Overall, Nelson averaged 21.1 points (1,522) and 10.9 rebounds (784) in his 72 game Iowa career. He left Iowa as the program's all-time leading scorer.[16] After his career at Iowa, Nelson was selected as the 17th draft pick in the 1962 NBA draft by the Chicago Zephyrs of the NBA. As a rookie, Nelson averaged 17 minutes, playing alongside Walt Bellamy (27.9 points), Terry Dischinger (25.5 points), Si Green and Charlie Hardnett. Zephyrs Coach Jack McMahon was replaced by player Slick Leonard halfway through the season as Chicago finished 25-55. The Chicago Zephyrs moved to become the Baltimore Bullets (today's Washington Wizards) after the season.[17] Nelson played for the Zephyrs for one season averaging 6.8 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.2 assists in 17 minutes. Nelson was then acquired by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1963. On September 6, 1963, Nelson was claimed on waivers by the Los Angeles Lakers from the Chicago Zephyrs. He would play in 80 games in 1963-1964, but just 39 in 1964-1965 under coach Fred Schaus.[18] In 1963-1964, Nelson played 80 games and averaged 5.2 points, 4.0 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 17 minutes for the Lakers, as Los Angeles finished 42-38. He saw his first playoff action, as the Lakers were defeated by the St. Louis Hawks (today's Atlanta Hawks), with Bob Pettit, Cliff Hagan and Lenny Wilkens 3-2. Nelson averaged 3.4 points and 2.6 rebounds in the series.[19][20] In 1964-1965, Nelson played little, averaging 2.4 points and 1.9 rebounds in just six minutes per game in 39 games. The Lakers used Nelson more in the playoffs as they defeated Nelson's former team, the Baltimore Bullets in the playoffs 4-2. Nelson averaged 5.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 2.0 assists in the series. The Lakers then faced the Boston Celtics in the 1965 NBA Finals. The Lakers lost to the Celtics 4-1, as Nelson averaged 7.2 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists and 20 minutes in the series.[21][22][23] After two seasons with the Lakers, where he averaged 4.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in 13 minutes playing alongside Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West, Nelson left Los Angeles.[22][18] After playing against them the season before in the NBA Finals, Nelson was signed as a free agent by the Boston Celtics on October 28, 1965.[22][18] In his first season with Boston and coach Red Auerbach, Nelson averaged 10.2 points and 5.4 rebounds, helping the Celtics to the 1966 NBA Championship over the Lakers. Nelson became a sixth man off the bench for Boston, playing alongside Hall of Famers Bill Russell, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, John Havlicek and KC Jones, as well as Larry Siegfried, Willie Naulls and Mel Counts.[24] Four more championships with Boston followed in 1968, 1969, 1974, and 1976. In 1967-1968, Nelson was one of seven Celtics to average in double figures, as the Celtics finished 54-28 under player/coach Bill Russell. Nelson joined Russell, Havlicek, Bailey Howell, Sam Jones, Sanders and Siegfried in double digit scoring. The Celtics defeated the Lakers 4-2 in the 1968 NBA Finals to capture the NBA Championship. In the 1968 NBA Finals, Nelson averaged 14.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 27 minutes.[25][26] In 1968-1969, Nelson averaged 11.6 points and 5.6 rebounds as Boston finished 48-34 under Russell. They defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 4-1 and the New York Knicks 4-2 to advance to the NBA finals, where again they faced the Lakers. In Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals, against his former team, Nelson converted one of the most famous shots in playoff history — a foul-line jumper which dropped through the basket after hitting the back rim and bouncing several feet straight up. The shot, taken with just over a minute to go in the game and the Celtics clinging to a 103–102 lead, helped secure Boston's 11th NBA title in 13 seasons and Nelson's third title with the Celtics.[27][28] In 1973-1974, after rebuilding, the Celtics finished 56-26 under coach Tommy Heinsohn, as Nelson averaged 11.5 points and 4.2 rebounds in 21.3 minutes at age 33. Nelson and Havlicek were now joined by Jo Jo White, Dave Cowens, Paul Westphal, Paul Silas and Don Chaney on the roster.[29] In the first playoff round against the Buffalo Braves (today's Los Angeles Clippers), Nelson scored over 20 points three times, averaging 15.7 points in the Celtics' a 4-2 series victory.[30] In the Eastern Conference finals against the New York Knicks, Nelson scored 23 points in a game 2 win, averaging 15 points in the 4-1 series victory. The Knicks had beaten the Celtics in the playoffs the previous two seasons.[31] In the 1974 NBA Finals, the Celtics faced the Milwaukee Bucks , with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Oscar Robertson and Bobby Dandridge. In game seven at Milwaukee, Nelson started over Silas and played a key part in double-teaming Abdul-Jabbar. He scored six points in 17 minutes as Boston had a 13-point halftime lead and won 102-87, securing their 4th NBA Championship with Nelson.[27][32][33] Nelson played his last season in 1975-1976, and won his 5th NBA Championship as Boston defeated the Phoenix Suns in the 1976 NBA Finals 4-2. Nelson averaged 6.4 points and 2.4 rebounds in the regular season and 9.1 points and 2.9 rebounds in the playoffs.[18][34] Nelson averaged more than 10 points per game every season between 1968–69 and 1974–75 (before the introduction of the three-point shot). He led the NBA in field-goal percentage in 1974–75 at age 34, the oldest and shortest player to do so. Nelson was coined as one of the best ""sixth men"" ever to play in the NBA. He was also known for his distinctive one-handed style for shooting free throws. He would place the ball in his shooting hand, lean in almost off-balance and toe the free-throw line with his right foot and his left leg trailing. He would then push the ball toward the basket completely with his right hand while springing with his right knee and lifting the trailing foot in a sort of ""hop"".[27][18] Nelson retired as a player following the 1975–76 season. His number 19 jersey was retired to the Boston Garden rafters in 1978. In 872 games with Boston over 11 seasons, Nelson averaged 11.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.6 assists.[18] Overall, in 1053 career NBA games, Nelson averaged 10.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 20.6 minutes, shooting 48.4% from the floor and 76.9% from the line. In 150 career playoff games, Nelson averaged 10.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 21.4 minutes, shooting 49.8% from the floor and 81.9% from the line.[18] After his career ended, Nelson's son Donnie remembers the family sitting in a Maid Rite restaurant in Moline, Illinois and Don saying he had three choices: sell cars, become an NBA referee, or accept an assistant's job under Milwaukee coach Larry Costello. They voted 5-0 for the Milwaukee job, which paid $25,000.[5] Nelson began his coaching career as an assistant with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1976. After a 3-15 start to the season, Larry Costello resigned and Nelson was named Head Coach.[35] A year later he became General Manager of the Bucks and soon began to show what would later become his signature style of wheeling and dealing players. Nelson made his first trade in 1977 by sending Swen Nater to the Buffalo Braves and turned the draft pick he received into Marques Johnson, who had a solid career with the Bucks. On November 25, 1977, the day after Thanksgiving, Nelson managed the greatest fourth-quarter comeback in NBA history. With Milwaukee down twenty-nine points to Atlanta, on the road, and with only 8:43 remaining, the Bucks went on a 35-4 run to win 117-115 in regulation. At the time, there was no three-point field goal. In 1980, he sent off an underachieving Kent Benson to the Detroit Pistons for Bob Lanier. Perhaps his most publicized deal came before the 1984–85 season when he dealt Johnson, Junior Bridgeman, Harvey Catchings, and cash to the San Diego Clippers for Terry Cummings, Craig Hodges, and Ricky Pierce. And, in 1986, he would deal Alton Lister to the Seattle SuperSonics for Jack Sikma. Taking over a Bucks team in the aftermath of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's departure to Los Angeles, Nelson was able to improve their win total by 14 games in his first full season as head coach, and established the team as a legitimate championship contender by 1980. It was in Milwaukee where Nelson became known for his unorthodox, innovative basketball philosophy. He pioneered the concept of the point forward – a tactic wherein small forwards are used to direct the offense. In Nelson's tenure with the Bucks, he used 6–5 small forward Paul Pressey for the role.[36] This enabled Nelson to field shooting guards Sidney Moncrief and Craig Hodges or Ricky Pierce at the same time without worrying about who would run the offense. In his offensive half-court sets, he would also put a center who wasn't a threat on offense, like Lister or Randy Breuer, at mid-court instead of near the basket to keep a shot-blocking center like the Utah Jazz's Mark Eaton away from the basket to make him less of a threat on defense. This system, known as ""Nellieball"", created a lot of mismatches and enabled Nelson to lead the Bucks to seven straight Central Division championships with over 50 wins in each of those seasons. He earned NBA Coach of the Year honors in 1983 and 1985. For seven straight years, finishing no worse than second best in the Eastern Conference, the Bucks ended up being eliminated in the playoffs by either the Larry Bird-led Boston Celtics or the Julius Erving-led Philadelphia 76ers. After the 1986-87 season, which included some controversy and distraction before Game 4 of the 1987 Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Boston Celtics where Nelson told the local sports media that he didn't expect to be back once the season concluded due to a rift with Bucks owner Herb Kohl,[37] Nelson left the Bucks. May 27, 1987, Nelson resigned as Head Coach of Milwaukee Bucks. In 11 seasons, Nelson had a 540-344 (.611) record with Milwaukee. With the Bucks, he was NBA Coach of the Year honors in 1983 and 1985.[38] Nelson did part-time work as a color analyst for NBA games on TBS during the 1987-88 season. During the season he was contacted by the Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors, and New York Knicks with offers to coach their teams. Nelson decided to go with Golden State, at first buying a minority stake in the team[39] before being named head coach and vice president after one season away from the NBA. In Golden State, he instilled a run-and-gun style of offense. Again using an unconventional lineup which featured three guards (Mitch Richmond, Tim Hardaway and Sarunas Marciulionis) and two forwards (Chris Mullin and the 6'8"" Rod Higgins at center), he coached the Warriors to a 23-game turnaround of their previous season and back into the playoffs with his lineup popularly known as Run TMC, for Tim, Mitch and Chris. Richmond and Mullin were later elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame after their careers. Nelson was named NBA Coach of the Year a third time after the 1991-92 season. Nelson continued to retool the team, drafting All-Star Latrell Sprewell in 1992. Nelson traded the Warriors' number 3 pick Anfernee Hardaway to the Orlando Magic for their number one overall pick Chris Webber during the 1993 NBA draft. Despite Webber averaging 17.5 points and 9.1 rebounds per game and winning the 1994 NBA Rookie of the Year Award, he found himself at odds with Nelson's preference to play him at center rather than power forward. Frequently clashing with one another, Webber threatened to use the out-clause in his contract if he wasn't traded. Nelson reportedly offered to resign rather than let the team trade away their young star, but nonetheless Webber was dealt to the Washington Bullets on November 7, 1994 for Tom Gugliotta and three future 1st round draft picks (1996, 1998 and 2000).[40] Nelson Resigned as Head Coach of Golden State Warriors on February 13, 1995. Nelson had made the playoffs with Golden State in four of his six seasons there. Subsequently, the Warriors did not qualify for the playoffs for the next 12 seasons, until he returned to the team in 2006. [38] In 1994, Nelson coached the Team USA national basketball team at the 1994 FIBA World Championship in Toronto, and led them to the Gold Medal.[41] The team was marketed as ""Dream Team II"".[42][43] Coached by Nelson, along with assistants Don Chaney, Pete Gillen and Rick Majerus, Team USA had a roster of Derrick Coleman, Joe Dumars, Tim Hardaway (Injured), Kevin Johnson, Larry Johnson, Shawn Kemp, Dan Majerle, Reggie Miller, Alonzo Mourning, Shaquille O'Neal, Mark Price, Steve Smith, Isiah Thomas (Injured) and Dominique Wilkins.[44] USA went 8-0, defeating Spain 115-100; China 132-77 and Brazil 105-82. In the Final Round, Team USA defeated Australia 130-74; Puerto Rico 134-83; Russia 111-94; and Greece 97-58. In the Gold Medal Game, Team USA defeated Russia 137-91.[44] Said Nelson, "" I really don't know why they chose me, to tell you the truth. But I do know I always wanted to coach a U.S. national team. I didn't really have any conversations with [the league or USA Basketball] in advance of them choosing me. But, heck, it was an honor. It was probably the top experience that I had as a coach. To stand up there and see your flag raised is a special thing.""[45] Nelson was hired by the New York Knicks after their original choice, Chuck Daly, declined their coaching offer.[46] In 1995, Nelson began his stint with the Knicks,[47] which lasted from July 1995 until March 1996. Nelson coached the Knicks to a respectable 34–25 record, but his up-tempo style of offense sharply contrasted the Knicks' defensive style of play.[48] Nelson also suggested the Knicks trade Patrick Ewing and a position to make an offer to Shaquille O'Neal, who was rumored to be interested in a move to New York.[48] On March 8, 1996, Nelson was fired as Head Coach by the New York Knicks. He was replaced by his assistant, Jeff Van Gundy. He had a 34-25 record. New York finished 13-10 with Van Gundy, for an overall record of 47-35.[49][38] Nelson was named head coach and general manager of the Dallas Mavericks in 1997. Nelson was coming to a team that had been dormant through the 90's and a permanent fixture in the NBA lottery. In 1998, his first full offseason in charge, Nelson worked out draft day deals with the Milwaukee Bucks and the Phoenix Suns: essentially trading the draft rights of Robert Traylor and Pat Garrity for Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash, whom he wanted to pair with the Mavericks rising star Michael Finley. The trio of Nash, Finley and Nowitzki became the foundation for the Mavericks dramatic turnaround, as Nelson coached the Mavericks to four consecutive 50-win seasons. The height of their success was a 60-win season in 2002-03, when they reached Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. An injury to Nowitzki in game 3 that kept him out for the rest of the series doomed the Mavericks as they lost in six games. Lacking an interior presence to combat low-post players such as Shaquille O'Neal, Nelson introduced the ""Hack-a-Shaq"" defense to the NBA while in Dallas. In the 2004 offseason, Steve Nash was offered a max contract from the Phoenix Suns; despite Nelson's insistence on matching the offer, Mark Cuban declined to and Nash accepted Phoenix's offer.[50] Nash won consecutive MVPs with the Suns the following two seasons. On March 19, 2005, Nelson stepped down as Dallas' Head Coach, naming Avery Johnson as his successor. Nelson retained his job as Dallas' GM until after the season, when he named his son, Assistant GM Donnie Nelson, as his replacement as GM. The Mavericks reached the NBA Finals the following season, though they would lose to Miami in six games. Nelson has spoke fondly of his time in Dallas, but admitted he lost in interest in remaining with the team when they did not re-sign Nash. In eight seasons with Dallas, Nelson had a 339-251 (.575) record.[38] On August 29, 2006, Nelson returned to the Golden State Warriors for a second stint as coach. Chris Mullin, a favorite of Nelson's from his first stint as Warriors head coach, was the team's general manager. Nelson's style of coaching favored the play of Baron Davis, Monta Ellis, Matt Barnes, Jason Richardson, and Andris Biedriņš. Midway through the season, Mullin (at behest of Nelson) orchestrated a trade with the Pacers to obtain Al Harrington and Stephen Jackson. The new lineup thrived under Nelson; Davis, Biedriņš and Jackson saw an increase in scoring and efficiency, Barnes went from a virtual unknown to a solid rotation contributor,[51] and Ellis was named the NBA's Most Improved Player after averaging 16.5 points per game, a substantial increase from his average of 6.8 points per game the prior season.[52] The Warriors closed out the season on a 16-5 run and just managed to qualify for the 2007 playoffs. Nelson faced his old team, the Mavericks, in the first round of the playoffs. The Mavs had the NBA's best record, and were a pick to win the NBA championship that year. In one of the biggest upsets in NBA playoff history, Nelson coached the 8th-seeded Warriors to series victory over the top-seeded Mavericks in six games. It was numerically the largest upset in the history of the NBA playoffs, with the 67–15 Mavericks' regular-season win-loss record 25 games better than the 42–40 Warriors'. The Warriors went on to lose to the Utah Jazz in the second round of the playoffs. On January 29, 2008, Chris Webber signed with the Warriors, reuniting with Nelson and returning to the team that had drafted him 15 years earlier.[53] His return lasted only nine games as he was forced to retire due to injuries,[54] but his return signaled closure to arguably the biggest blemish on Nelson's otherwise impressive resume as a player's coach.[55] The Warriors finished 48–34 that season-their most wins since 1993–94 (during his first stint as coach). However, in a Western Conference where all eight playoff teams won at least 50 games, they missed the playoffs by two games. The next two seasons saw the Warriors plunge back into mediocrity (29-53 and 26-56), losing most of the players from their 2007 playoff run to either trades or free agency. The first of his two losing seasons did give the Warriors the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft, and Nelson pushed the team to draft Stephen Curry, despite skepticism from critics. Curry would go on to win back-to-back MVP awards and helped lead Golden State to championships in 2015, 2017, and 2018.[56][57] On September 23, Comcast SportsNet Bay Area, Nelson announced he would resign as head coach.[58] The San Francisco Chronicle reported that new owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber wanted ""a young, up-and-coming coach"" to help revive the Warriors' fortunes. Longtime assistant Keith Smart succeeded Nelson as coach.[59] Nelson, in February 2011, said on Bay Area radio station KNBR that he was fired: ""I talked to (Lacob) on the phone before I got fired, and I was really impressed. I was a little surprised with the way things happened, but I think it is for the best for everybody.""[60] In 11 total seasons with Golden State, Nelson's teams finished. 422-443 (.488). He ended his coaching career with 2398 games and a 1335-1063 (.557) record.[38] On December 29, 2001, Don Nelson became the third coach in NBA history to win 1,000 games, behind Lenny Wilkens and Pat Riley. Nelson won his 1,300th career game on February 21, 2009, joining Wilkens as the only coach to pass this milestone. Don Nelson defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves on April 7, 2010, achieving his 1,333rd career win. He passed Lenny Wilkens for first all-time on the list of the NBA's winningest coaches. Nelson married Joy Wolfgram at the Oakland Coliseum in June 1991.[61] Nelson and his wife have a total of six children from prior marriages.[61][62] He has a daughter born out of wedlock and put up for adoption, whom he did not know about for 29 years, who first reached out to him in 1997, not wanting anything in return. She now lives in Maui near Nelson and his wife.[62] He had fifteen grandchildren as of 2012.[63] Nelson's son, Donnie Nelson is the general manager of the Dallas Mavericks. Donnie was Don's assistant coach with the Mavericks when Don won his 1,000th NBA game. Donnie moved from coaching to become the president of basketball operations for the Mavericks in 2002 while his father was still coaching Dallas. Donnie Nelson was an assistant coach for Lithuania in the 1992, 1996 and 2000 Olympics.[64][65] Nelson calls Dirk Nowitzki his ""German son."" Nelson coach Nowitzki for his first six NBA seasons in Dallas.[66] ""In my second game ever in the NBA -- obviously I wasn't a defensive presence -- he wanted me out there in the game but he didn't have anybody for me to guard,"" recalled Nowitzki. ""So he let me guard [5-foot-3] Muggsy Bogues for a couple possessions. He said, 'Just stand there in the paint and wave at him. He doesn't want to shoot.'""[64] In the summers, while a player and when he became an NBA coach, Nelson would continually work with his Rock Island High School coach Bob Riley at a basketball camp and the two would play golf after. Riley died in 2009. ""He always made sure he checked in on my dad,"" said Bob's son Jack Riley.[67] Nelson had a hand in the Celtics drafting teammate Steve Kuberski. While with the Celtics, Nelson would return home to the Quad Cities and played with Kuberski, then at Bradley University, at the Moline YMCA. Kuberski was from Moline, Illinois and had played at Moline High School, a Western Big 6 rival of Nelson's alma mater Rock Island High School. ""We were just playing one-on-one but he went back to Boston and said they should take a look at this kid when his class comes up,"" Kuberski said of Nelson's influence. ""They drafted me on whim a year early.""[68] After his playing career ended, Nelson refereed basketball games in the summer league, thinking that becoming a referee might be his next career. ""I never thought about coaching. I always wondered what in the world I'm going to do when I retire. That's why I tried refereeing,"" Nelson said.[69] ""He sucked as a referee, according to what he tells me,"" said Nelson's former teammate Joel Novak, who played with Nelson at both Rock Island High School and the University of Iowa. Nelson credits Novak for a lot of his rebounds for missing many shots.[70][69] During the 1986 season, Nelson established The Don Nelson Fund with the help of the Milwaukee Bucks to aid struggling farmers in Wisconsin. The idea originated from Wisconsin dairy farmer Clarence Willcome, to whom Nelson donated his $11,000 1986 NBA Playoffs bonus compensation. Nelson headed a weight loss drive to raise more money for Willcome and the Wisconsin Farm Fund.[71] Nelson had prostate cancer surgery in 2000.[65] Nelson graduated from the University of Iowa with a degree in physical education in 2012. He left Iowa in 1962 with his degree coursework nearly completed. He later took Spanish classes to fulfill some of his missing 8 foreign language credit hours. He still lacked student-teaching credits. When Nelson called the university, after being inspired by Shaquille O'Neal to finish his degree, Iowa decided that his lifetime of teaching through NBA coaching would fulfill that requirement and invited him to the graduation ceremony in 2012. He attended and received his diploma with over 45 family and friends accompanying him.[72][73] As of April 2018, Nelson lives in Maui, where he has a farm to grow flowers, coffee, and cannabis.[62] He hosts local poker games with celebrities such as Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson, and Owen Wilson.[62] “I know how far I’ve come from being a hog farmer,” Nelson said of his career. “I’ve come a long, long way from being some country kid. I got in the fast lane, and I’ve stayed there a long time. I’ve done pretty well.""[4] ""All I can tell you is he's happy. He's in Maui, drinking Mai Tais and watching sunsets and whales. Life's good,"" said his son Donnie.[64]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/225.png
226,Tom Nissalke,"July 7, 1932","August 22, 2019",,,1973,1984,9,true,,"""[2, 1, 2, 6]""",/coaches/nissato99c.html,"Thomas Edward Nissalke (July 7, 1932 – August 22, 2019) was an American professional basketball coach in the National Basketball Association and American Basketball Association. He coached several teams in both leagues, and had an overall coaching record of 371–508. After a season with the Dallas Chaparrals (where he won ABA coach of the Year), Nissalke moved to the NBA with the Sonics for one season. He returned to the team, now in San Antonio, in 1973, bringing with him ""a patterned, deliberate offense to San Antonio"". During his tenure, the ""Iceman"" George Gervin had arrived from the Virginia Squires and was the center of the team. Though Nissalke's club was successful, he was fired in the beginning of the 1974–75 ABA season. Nissalke, who is a graduate of Florida State University, first got his start in coaching on the high school-prep level at the Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. He later worked his way onto the college ranks at the University of Wisconsin and Tulane. Nissalke started his coaching career at Wayland Academy as the varsity boys basketball coach when he was hired by Ray Patterson (basketball), his former coach. Nissalke coached there from 1957 until 1962 when he went on to the college ranks, thus advancing his career. He finished with an overall record of 49–41 at Wayland. 1957–58 Overall record 6–12 Conference record 5–9 1958–59 Overall record 13–5 1959–60 Overall record 9–9 1960–61 Overall record 12–5 Conference record 12–2 (conference champions) 1961–62 Overall record 9–10 Nissalke then went to Utah with the ABA's Stars, but the club folded, surprisingly, at mid-season in the ABA's last hurrah in 1975–76. According to Remember the ABA, he has the final game ball in his closet. Nissalke later coached the other Texas professional basketball team, the NBA's Houston Rockets (winning another Coach of the Year in the NBA in 76–77), followed by the Utah Jazz and Cleveland Cavaliers, retiring in 1985. Nissalke holds the rare distinction of being named ""Coach of the Year"" in both the NBA and the ABA. He was also the commissioner of the short-lived National Basketball League in Canada in 1993–94. He had a combined coaching record of 371–508 (248–391 in NBA and 123–117 in ABA), with an 11–20 playoff record. He went 105–91 with the Chaparrals/Spurs, 13–32 with the Sonics, 18–26 with the Utah Stars, 124–122 with the Rockets, 60–124 with the Jazz, and 51–113 with the Cavaliers. He made it out of the first round of the playoffs just once, in 1977. Nissalke's entrepreneurial activities included developing and owning several health clubs throughout Texas in addition to co-owning a successful bar and restaurant, Green Street in Salt Lake City, Utah for over twenty years. After his coaching career, Nissalke took on revamping the YMCA of Utah and served as Chairman of the Board and later interim CEO. The YMCA had its most successful fundraising campaigns during his tenure. Nissalke was the coach of Puerto Rico at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, finishing in 9th place with a 2–5 record. Nissalke's squad came close to upsetting the United States, losing by a 94–93 score. In January 2006, his wife of 46 years, Nancy, who also was a native of Madison, Wisconsin, died, succumbing to cancer. Together they had two children, son Thomas Jr., and daughter Holly, as well as two granddaughters Caroline Anne and Isabelle Grace. On August 22, 2019, Nissalke died at his home in Salt Lake City, Utah.[1]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/226.png
227,Nick Nurse,"July 24, 1967",,,University of Northern Iowa,2019,2020,2,false,,"""[2]""",/coaches/nurseni01c.html,"Nicholas David Nurse (born July 24, 1967) is an American basketball coach who is the head coach of the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Canadian men's national team. Born Nicholas David Nurse in Carroll, Iowa,[1][2] Nick Nurse played at the University of Northern Iowa from 1985 to 1989, appearing in 111 games. He is the school's all-time 3-point percentage leader at .468 (170 of 363).[3] In his last year with Northern Iowa, Nurse became an assistant coach for the team during the 1989–90 season. After graduating from Northern Iowa in May 1990 with a B.A. in accounting,[1] Nurse became a player-coach for the Derby Rams in the British Basketball League for the 1990–91 season. Nurse got his first full-time head coaching job at Grand View University when he was only 23 years old; at the time, he was the youngest college basketball head coach in the country.[4] He coached at Grand View for two seasons before taking on an assistant coaching role at the University of South Dakota for two seasons. Nurse later spent 11 seasons coaching in Europe, mostly in the British Basketball League (BBL).[4] During that time, he won two BBL championships as a head coach, one with the Birmingham Bullets in 1996 and one with the Manchester Giants in 2000, while also helping London Towers in the Euroleague.[5] Nurse also won the BBL Coach of the Year Award in the 1999–2000 and 2003–04 seasons.[6] He also coached for the Telindus Oostende of the Ethias League in 1998, as well as became an assistant coach for the Oklahoma Storm of the United States Basketball League in both 2001 and 2005. In 2007, Nurse accepted the head coaching job for the Iowa Energy, who were preparing for their first season in the NBA D-League (now called the NBA G League).[7] The Energy won division titles under Nurse in the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons. After three seasons with the team, Nurse agreed to join the coaching staff of the Iowa State Cyclones as an associate head coach in April 2010.[6] Shortly afterwards, however, Cyclones head coach Greg McDermott left Iowa State to become the head coach at Creighton, and Nurse returned to his former position as head coach with the Energy.[8][9] In the 2010–11 NBA D-League season, Nurse received the Dennis Johnson Coach of the Year Award after helping Iowa achieve the best record in the league (37–13).[10] Nurse and the Energy then went on to win the 2011 D-League championship.[11] Before the 2011–12 season, Nurse left the Energy for the D-League's Rio Grande Valley Vipers.[12][13] In the 2012–13 season, the Vipers finished with a record of 35–15 and won the D-League finals in a two-game sweep of the Santa Cruz Warriors.[14] During his six seasons coaching in the D-League, Nurse had 23 players on his rosters called up to the NBA.[15] In July 2013, Nurse departed the Vipers for an assistant job on the coaching staff of the Toronto Raptors under Dwane Casey.[16] He was in charge of the offense during his time under Casey,[15][17] and in the 2017–18 season he was credited for changes to the Raptors offensive game plan which included increases in passing and 3-point attempts.[18][19][20] The improved offense helped the Raptors win a franchise-record 59 games, but the team was swept in the second round of the 2018 NBA playoffs by the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Casey was fired shortly thereafter.[21] On June 14, 2018, the Raptors promoted Nurse to the position of head coach to succeed Casey.[22] On May 25, 2019, Nurse coached the Raptors to the 2019 NBA Finals, the first for the franchise, after taking the Eastern Conference Championship by defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in six games.[23] On June 13, Nurse became the first head coach to win both the NBA and NBA G League (formerly D-League) titles,[24] when the Raptors defeated the Golden State Warriors in Game 6 of the NBA Finals, winning the Raptors their first championship in franchise history.[25] In 2020, Nurse qualified to be the head coach in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game, as the Eastern Conference representative.[26] Nurse was an assistant coach under Chris Finch, for the Great Britain national team from 2009 to 2012, including the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. On June 24, 2019, Nurse was named the head coach of the Canadian men's national team for the 2019 FIBA World Cup and beyond.[27][28] Nurse and his wife Roberta have two sons.[29] He also has a nephew named David, who previously worked with the Brooklyn Nets before becoming a personal trainer for professional players.[30] In December 2018, Nurse's mother Marcella died.[31] Nurse is a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan and was a guest conductor of the seventh-inning stretch at Wrigley Field in 2019, singing ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game.""[32]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/227.png
228,Jim O'Brien,"February 11, 1952",,"Roman Catholic HS in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",Saint Joseph's,2001,2011,9,true,,"""[2, 2, 1]""",/coaches/obrieji99c.html,"James J. O'Brien (born April 9, 1950)[1][2] is an American college basketball coach who has served as coach of St. Bonaventure University (1982–1986), Boston College (1986–1997), Ohio State University (1997–2004) and Emerson College, a Division III school in Boston (2011–2014). O'Brien was hired as head coach on April 7, 1997 after Ohio State had fired previous coach Randy Ayers. O'Brien guided the Buckeye program to the 1999 Final Four, 2000 and 2002 Big Ten regular-season co-championships, the 2002 Big Ten Tournament Championship, four 20-win seasons and a school record four-consecutive NCAA tournament appearances (1999–2002). Ohio State later had to vacate all wins from 1999 to 2002, remove all references to team accomplishments for those years, and pay back all tournament money due to rules violations during O'Brien's tenure. On June 8, 2004, then-Ohio State athletic director Andy Geiger fired O'Brien for alleged NCAA rules violations. The Ohio Court of Claims determined that Ohio State breached its contract with O'Brien by terminating him and awarded him $2.4 million. However, O'Brien was given an NCAA ""show-cause"" order effectively banning him from coaching from 2006 to 2008, and only returned to coaching in 2011. A high school honorable mention All-American at St. Francis Prep in Brooklyn, O'Brien went on to attend and then graduate from Boston College in 1971 with a degree in marketing. He was the recipient of the university's scholar-athlete award as a senior. O'Brien was a three-year Boston College letterman (1968–71) while playing for Bob Cousy and Chuck Daly and he was team captain in 1970–71. He still holds the school single-game record for assists with 18, vs. Le Moyne December 16, 1970. He scored 1,273 points, a total that ranks 14th on the school's all-time scoring list. He twice won all-East honors and was the New England Player of the Year as a senior. He was elected into the Boston College Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 1976, his first year of eligibility. He also has the unique honor of being named to two Boston College all-decade basketball teams (1960s and 1970s). Upon graduation, O'Brien was selected by the Buffalo Braves (today the Los Angeles Clippers) in the fourth round of the 1971 NBA draft, but he instead played professionally for the Pittsburgh Condors (1971), the Kentucky Colonels (1972–73) and the San Diego Conquistadors (1974–75) in the American Basketball Association. He played for Wilt Chamberlain at San Diego. After his playing career was over, O'Brien jumped into coaching in 1977 as an assistant at the University of Connecticut under Dom Perno. He spent five years there, during which time the Huskies were 91-50 and made three post season appearances. St. Bonaventure University hired O'Brien in 1982. He stayed four years as head coach before returning to his alma mater in 1986, succeeding Gary Williams who had been named head coach at The Ohio State University. He was Atlantic 10 Conference Co-Coach of the Year in 1983, when he led St. Bonaventure to a 20-10 record and a berth in the National Invitation Tournament. Basketball Times named him as its National Rookie Coach of the Year in 1983. O'Brien coached for eleven seasons at Boston College. This tenure included NCAA tournament appearances in three of his last four seasons and postseason appearances in five of his last six years. O'Brien was named Big East Co-Coach of the Year honor in 1995–96, Kodak District I Coach of the Year in both 1992 and 1993, and Eastern Basketball Coach of the Year in 1994. In 1994, O'Brien led Boston College to the Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament and scored back-to-back wins over Indiana and North Carolina. Academics were a strong priority throughout O'Brien's coaching career – in his first 10 years at Boston College, all 25 players who completed their eligibility also earned their degrees. During his final season at Boston College, O'Brien led the team to the 1997 Big East regular-season and tournament titles. However, O'Brien began running into problems getting his recruits past the admissions office after star recruit Chris Herren was kicked out of school in 1994 for drug and discipline problems; he eventually transferred to Fresno State. During 1995 and 1996, at least three prospective recruits were denied admission despite easily meeting NCAA standards. When two Boston-area recruits were turned down in November 1996, O'Brien nearly resigned.[3] He ultimately left for Ohio State after the 1996–97 season and took nearly all of his players with him, including star freshman point guard Scoonie Penn. O'Brien subsequently sued Boston College for slander and breach of contract, suggesting racial bias may have played a role in why one of his recruits was denied admission.[4] With Penn and most of the new arrivals forced to sit out the season, O'Brien's first year in Columbus was a long one. The Buckeyes finished with an 8-22 record, including a 1-15 mark in Big Ten play—the school's worst conference record ever. The following year, however, O'Brien directed the Buckeyes to the 1999 Final Four in St. Petersburg, Florida. Ohio State set numerous school, conference and NCAA records during the 1998–99 season on its way to the school's ninth trip to the Final Four. The 2000 Buckeyes followed that effort by sharing the Big Ten championship with Michigan State. These accomplishments would later be vacated by the NCAA. The 2001 edition of Ohio State basketball was picked to finish near the bottom of the Big Ten in preseason publications; however O'Brien managed to finish third in the regular season conference standings, winning 20 games and earning the school's 21st (of 24 total) NCAA tournament appearance, all this despite losing its top three scorers from the 1999–2000 season. The 2002 Buckeyes also were not picked to produce a successful season. Again, O'Brien surprised the critics by guiding the Buckeyes to a share of the 2002 Big Ten regular-season and tournament title, 20 victories and an unprecedented fourth-consecutive trip to the NCAA tournament, a feat never before accomplished at Ohio State. Following OSU's 1999 Final Four run, O'Brien was honored as the 1999 Clair Bee Coach of the Year. The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame presents the award. This honor was one of several including: the 1999 National Coach of the Year given by the Touchdown Club of Columbus; the 1999 National Co-Coach of the Year given by the National Association of Basketball Coaches; the 1999 Big Ten Coach of the Year as selected by the Big Ten media and the 1999 U.S. Basketball Writers Association District 5 Coach of the Year. He claimed his second Big Ten Coach of the Year award in 2001 when the league media gave him the honor for the second time in three seasons. The 2001 District 10 Coach of the Year Award, given by the National Association of Basketball Coaches, followed the Big Ten honors. Ohio State fired O'Brien on June 8, 2004 claiming the coach had admitted to athletic director Andy Geiger that he had provided a $6,000 loan to the mother of one-time recruit Aleksandar Radojević from Serbia after he had signed a national letter of intent in 1999. NCAA rules do not allow players to receive financial assistance from outside their family. The payment came to light when Kathleen Salyers, a nanny from the Columbus suburb of Gahanna, sued Ohio State boosters Dan and Kim Roslovic. Salyers claimed the Roslovics reneged on an agreement to pay her $1,000 per month plus expenses to care for Ohio State forward Boban Savovic. Savovic couldn't live with the Roslovics due to their status as Ohio State boosters. As part of her deposition, Salyers revealed that O'Brien had made the loan to Radojevic. Radojevic couldn't play collegiately because he'd been paid for playing overseas.[5] O'Brien claimed Ohio State improperly fired him and sued the university for $3.5 million in lost wages and benefits. O'Brien argued his loan did not violate NCAA bylaws because he knew Radojevic already had lost his amateur status by playing for money overseas. At trial, Geiger and NCAA lead investigator Steve Duffin both testified that O'Brien made the loan for humanitarian reasons, not as an inducement to get Radojevic to sign with Ohio State. NCAA infractions committee chairman David Swank testified that O'Brien's actions did not violate NCAA rules. A judge found Ohio State had breached the contract and awarded O'Brien $2.4 million. The award was upheld on appeal to the Ohio Court of Appeals and Ohio Supreme Court.[6] On March 10, 2006, the NCAA gave Ohio State three years' probation and ordered it to pay back all tournament money earned from 1999 to 2002 when Boban Savovic was on the Buckeyes' roster. In addition, Ohio State was forced to vacate every game it played from 1998–99 to 2001–02, including its 1999 Final Four appearance. O'Brien was also subjected to a five-year ""show-cause"" order. In 2007, the NCAA reduced the term of O'Brien's show-cause order to two years. It also threw out three violations and part of a fourth due to the enforcement staff's own failure to file NCAA rules and procedures.[7] On January 31, 2008, an NCAA appeals committee lifted all restrictions on O'Brien's hiring.[8] On May 10, 2011, O'Brien was named head coach at Emerson College.[9] After guiding the Lions to a 34-44 record over three seasons, O'Brien announced his retirement.[10] * Record adjusted to 1–1 after games forfeited ** Record adjusted to 11–3 after games forfeited ***Record adjusted to 0–0 after games forfeited ****Not including forfeited games Jim O'Brien and his late wife, Christine, had two daughters, Mrs. Amy Siggens and Mrs. Erin Wright.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/228.png
229,Kevin O'Neill,"January 24, 1957",,,McGill University,2004,2004,1,true,,"""[2]""",/coaches/oneilke99c.html,"Kevin James O'Neill (born January 24, 1957) is an American basketball coach with experience as the head coach of various college and National Basketball Association (NBA) teams. Most recently he was the coach of the USC Trojans basketball team. O'Neill was born in Malone, New York and attended McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He lettered in basketball for three years in college, 1976–79, and in 1978 the McGill Redman had a school-record 28 win season and entered the Canadian Interuniversity Sport men's basketball championship tournament. He graduated from McGill in 1979 with a bachelor's degree in education, and later earned his master's degree in secondary education from Marycrest College in 1983, where he also served as head coach of the NAIA basketball team for the 1982–83 season.[1] Born in Malone, New York, O'Neill grew up in nearby Chateaugay and graduated from Chateaugay Central School in 1975. O'Neill's head coaching career began with tenures at North Country Community College (Saranac Lake, New York), Marycrest College (Davenport, Iowa), Marquette, Tennessee and Northwestern. During his tenure as the Northwestern coach O'Neill is most notably remembered for a game with Indiana where the rowdy Northwestern faithful chanted ""Hoosier Daddy"" (a play on ""Who's Your Daddy?"") at opposing coach Bob Knight. Of course this did not sit well with Knight as he and O'Neill got into it during the contest. However all was settled under a practice gym basket well after the game as ESPN camera crews caught the coaches talking their issues out. He would eventually become an assistant coach under Jeff Van Gundy with the New York Knicks. In 2001, he joined the Detroit Pistons under head coach Rick Carlisle. As the head coach at Marquette, O'Neill led the then-Warriors to two 20+ win seasons, two NCAA tournament appearances, and a Great Midwest Conference Championship. O'Neill played a prominent role in the 1994 Oscar-nominated documentary, Hoop Dreams'. The McGill University graduate returned to Canada in June 2003 as the head coach of the Toronto Raptors. His tenure was marked by inconsistency among his players, but the team was 25–25 after 50 games and in a position to return to the playoffs. However, injuries to key players resulted in the team going 8–24 to finish the season three games out of a playoff spot. On April 17, 2004, O'Neill was fired in the aftermath of a disappointing 2003–2004 season, after making some remarks which were taken to question the team's commitment to winning.[2] In the 2004–2005 season he was hired as an assistant coach with the Indiana Pacers where he rejoined head coach Rick Carlisle.[3] On May 1, 2007 it was announced that O'Neill would replace Jim Rosborough as the assistant coach to Hall of Famer Lute Olson at the University of Arizona.[4] O'Neill was an assistant under Olson during Arizona's rise to national prominence in the 1980s, and used it as a launching board to attain his first major head coaching position at Marquette. On November 4, 2007, Olson announced that he was taking an ""indefinite leave of absence"", and that O'Neill would assume Olson's head coaching duties in his absence.[5] On December 6 Olson released a statement stating that he would be extending his leave of absence for the remainder of the season. He cited personal family reasons that required his immediate attention; the next day, his attorney revealed that Olson had filed for divorce from his second wife.[6] The same day it was announced that O'Neill would remain the interim head coach for the rest of the season.[7] Later the same month, on December 18, Arizona athletic director Jim Livengood announced O'Neill as the designated successor to Olson. Olson said at the time he planned to return for the 2008–09 season; Livengood stated that O'Neill would succeed Olson upon his retirement.[8] In March 2008, Olson confirmed that he would return as head coach for the 2008–2009 season, and said that he planned to coach until his contract ended in 2011.[9] With the announcement of Olson's return, the O'Neill succession plan was thrown into question amidst media rumors of disagreement between Olson and O'Neill.[10] Only a month later, Lute Olson announced that O'Neill would not be retained on the University of Arizona staff.[11] After spending the spring and summer preparing for the upcoming season, Olson abruptly and unexpectedly announced his permanent retirement from the Arizona basketball program in October 2008; his personal physician cited health concerns as the reason.[12] In May 2008, O'Neill was hired as an assistant coach & special assistant to the GM [13] for the Memphis Grizzlies. On June 20, 2009, O'Neill was named head coach of the USC men's basketball team.[14] O'Neill was involved in an altercation with an Arizona Wildcats booster at his hotel on March 10, 2011. As a result, O'Neill was suspended for the rest of the Pac-10 tournament,[15] which resulted in a 67–62 loss for the Trojans.[16] O'Neill's 2012–2013 entered the season with high hopes based around a number of transfers coming in from other programs. The team started the season 3–6, fueling speculation that it would be O'Neill's last at USC. Much of this speculation was due to the fact that O'Neill sold his Los Angeles home, and relocated to Coronado, CA, which is located over 125 miles away from USC.[17] On January 14, 2013 Pat Haden, USC Athletic Director, announced that O'Neill had been relieved of his duties at the University after beginning the season 7–10 (2–2 Pac-12). In October 2013, O'Neill joined Fox Sports as a college basketball analyst.[18] * All 19 wins and 1 tournament loss from 2007–08 season was later vacated ** Final record at Arizona after vacated wins *** Takes into account vacated wins at Arizona",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/229.png

231,Bob Pettit,"December 12, 1932",,"Baton Rouge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana",LSU,1962,1962,1,true,,"""[1]""",/coaches/pettibo01c.html,"Robert Lee Pettit Jr. (born December 12, 1932) is an American retired professional basketball player. He played 11 seasons in the NBA, all with the Milwaukee/St. Louis Hawks (1954–1965). He was the first recipient of the NBA's Most Valuable Player Award. He also won the NBA All-Star Game MVP award four times, a feat matched only by Kobe Bryant. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1970. Pettit's basketball career had humble beginnings, at Baton Rouge High School, he was cut from the varsity basketball team as both a freshman and sophomore. He played church league basketball as a sophomore and grew five inches in less than a year. His father, Sheriff of East Baton Rouge Parish (1932–1936), pushed him to practice in the backyard of the Kemmerly house until he improved his skills. It worked: Pettit became a starter and made the All-City prep team as a junior. As a 6-7 senior, he led Baton Rouge High to its first State Championship in over 20 years. Pettit was then selected to play in a North–South all-star game at Murray, Kentucky.[2] After high school, Pettit had scholarship offers from 14 universities but he accepted a scholarship to play at Louisiana State University (LSU). He was a three-time All-Southeastern Conference selection and a two-time All-American as a member of the LSU men's basketball team. (Freshmen were not allowed to play varsity basketball in those days.) During those three years, Pettit averaged 27.8 points per game. He was also a member of the Zeta Zeta Chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon at LSU. Pettit made his varsity debut at LSU in 1952. He led the SEC in scoring for his first of three consecutive seasons, averaging 25.5 points per game. He ranked third in the nation in scoring and also averaged 13.1 rebounds per game, helping his team to a 17-7 win-loss record for a second-place finish in the league, and was selected to the All-SEC team. During his junior year, Pettit helped the Tigers sail through a 23-game regular-season schedule with only one loss (to Tulsa). A clean sweep of SEC Conference opponents became LSU's second SEC Title (their first came in 1935) and the school's first NCAA Final Four. He averaged 24.9 points and 13.9 rebounds per game for the 1953 season. He was honored with selections to both the All-SEC and All-American teams. Pettit averaged 31.4 points and 17.3 rebounds per game during his senior year and once again led LSU to an SEC Championship and garnered All-SEC and All-American honors. He set a then-SEC scoring record of 60 points against Louisiana College in his second game, and also the SEC record for scoring average, with both records being broken by Pete Maravich. Pettit also was the second player in major-college basketball history to average more than 30 points a game.[2] In 1954, his number 50 was retired at LSU. He was the first Tiger athlete in any sport to receive this distinction. In 1999, he was named Living Legend for LSU at the SEC Basketball Tournament. He is a member of the LSU Hall of Fame. Bob Pettit Boulevard in Baton Rouge, Louisiana is named after him. In 1954, the Milwaukee Hawks selected Pettit second in the first round of the NBA Draft after the Baltimore Bullets' selection of Frank Selvy. With $100 in the bank, he signed a contract with Hawks owner Ben Kerner for $11,000 – an all-time high for an NBA rookie then. Pettit's awkward ballhandling and a lack of strength to battle NBA bruisers weighing 200 pounds that early in his career, had Hawks coach Red Holzman move him from center, his position at LSU, to forward in his first training camp. ""In college I played the standing pivot"", he said in a April 1957 issue of SPORT magazine interview. ""My back was to the basket. In the pros, I'm always outside. Everything I do is facing the basket now. That was my chief difficulty in adjusting, the fact that I had never played forward before."" Though many were skeptical about Pettit making the transition from college to the rough-and-tumble NBA, in 1955 he won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award after averaging 20.4 points and 13.8 rebounds per game. He became the second rookie to win all-NBA honors but the team finished last in the Western Division.[2] After the season, the Hawks moved to St. Louis. He helped the Hawks improve during their first year in St. Louis by winning 33 games during 1955–56. In his second season, Pettit adjusted his game so that he would get to the free-throw line for easy points for his team and foul trouble for his opponents. Being a phenomenal offensive rebounder and an instinctive scorer, he told basketball historian Terry Pluto that ""Offensive rebounds were worth eight to 12 points a night to me. Then I'd get another eight to 10 at the free-throw line. All I had to do was make a few jump shots and I was on my way to a good night."" [3] Pettit won his first scoring title with a 25.7 average, and led the league in rebounding (1164 for a 16.2 average). He was also named MVP of the 1956 NBA All-Star Game after scoring 20 points with 24 rebounds and 7 assists; he would win subsequent MVP All-Star Game honors in 1958, 1959, and 1962. He also won his first of two NBA regular season MVP awards (the other was in 1959). Retooling before the 1956–57 season, the Hawks acquired Ed Macauley and rookie Cliff Hagan from the Boston Celtics for the draft rights to Bill Russell. The team added guard Slater Martin in an early-season deal with the New York Knicks while Alex Hannum arrived a few weeks later after being released by the Fort Wayne Pistons. Hannum became the team's third coach that season by taking over as player-coach with 31 games left on the schedule. Though they posted a 34-38 record in 1956–57, a series of tie-breaking playoff games against the Pistons and a three-game sweep of the Minneapolis Lakers had them in the NBA Finals. In Game 1 of the 1957 NBA Finals at the Boston Garden, Pettit scored 37 points as the Hawks shocked the Bill Russell-led Boston Celtics in double overtime. Pettit won his team the third game in the series with a late basket in St. Louis. His two free throws with six seconds left in Game 7 forced overtime, but Pettit's 39 points and 19 rebounds in 56 minutes weren't enough to win a double-overtime game. Pettit averaged 29.8 points and 16.8 rebounds per game during their 1957 playoff run. A franchise record 41 wins and a division crown allowed the Hawks to get back at the Celtics in the 1958 NBA Finals. Pettit led the Hawks to an NBA Championship with a then-playoff record 50 points in the Hawks' 110-109 series clinching victory in game 6. Both teams would later meet in the 1960 and 1961 Finals, with Boston winning each time. For the season, Pettit scored 24.6 ppg and pulled down 17.4 rpg, and earned All-Star Game MVP honors with a performance that included 28 points and 26 rebounds. St. Louis finished at the top of the Western Division in each of the next three seasons. Pettit's league leading scoring average of 29.2 points per game in the 1958–59 season was an NBA record at the time, and he was named the Sporting News NBA MVP. In the 1960–61 season, Pettit averaged 27.9 points per game[4] and pulled down 20.3 rebounds per game, making him one of only five players to ever break the 20 rpg barrier. He, along with Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry Lucas, are the only three people who averaged more than twenty points and twenty rebounds in an NBA season. On February 18, 1961, Pettit scored a career-high 57 points and grabbed 28 rebounds in a 141-138 win over the Detroit Pistons.[5] In the following season, he scored a career best 31.1 points per game, but the Hawks slipped to fourth place. After missing 30 games because of injuries, Pettit ended his career in 1965 still near the peak of his game. He was the first NBA player to eclipse the 20,000 points mark (20,880 for a 26.4 average). Of the 20,880 points he scored in the NBA, 6,182 of them (nearly 30 percent) came from free throws. His 12,849 rebounds were second most in league history at the time he retired, and his 16.2 rebounds per game career average remains third only to Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell. Pettit was an NBA All-Star in each of his 11 seasons, was named to the All-NBA First Team ten times, and was named to the All-NBA Second Team once. Pettit still holds the top two NBA All-Star Game rebounding performances with 26 in 1958 and 27 in 1962, and has the second highest All-Star Game points per game average with 20.4 (behind only Oscar Robertson). Pettit averaged at least 20 points per game and at least 12 rebounds per game in each of his 11 NBA seasons. He never finished below seventh in the NBA scoring race[4] and no other retired player in NBA history other than Pettit and Alex Groza (who played only two seasons) has averaged more than 20 points per game in every season they've played (note: Michael Jordan averaged exactly 20 points per game in his final season). In 1970, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Pettit was named to the NBA's 35th Anniversary Team in 1980,[3] and was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996.

Phillip led his high school in Granite City, Illinois, to the IHSA state championship in 1940 by defeating Herrin High School with a final score of 24–22 at Huff Gym on the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign campus. Ironically it would be that same gymnasium where he earned renown for his talents and for the Fighting Illini's success during war-interrupted, non-consecutive seasons in 1941–1943 and 1946–1947.[3] Phillip was the untitled leader of ""The Whiz Kids"", a team that included Ken Menke, Gene Vance, Jack Smiley and team captain Art Mathisen. Arguably the most talented basketball team in the nation, Phillip and his teammates would elect not to participate in either the NCAA or NIT tournament based on the army's draft of Mathisen, Menke and Smiley.[4] The team was retroactively named the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[5] Four of the five, minus Mathisen, returned to Illinois and tried to recapture the glory for one more season in 1946–47 after the war ended, but the chemistry had changed as well as their talent. Illinois went 14–6. While attending Illinois, Phillip was a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. Phillip served as a first lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps in World War II at Iwo Jima.[6][7] Phillip played in the first five NBA All-Star Games, and was twice named to the All-NBA Second Team. He was the first player to record 500 assists in a season, and led the NBA in assists during the 1950–51 and 1951–52 seasons. Phillip reached the postseason every year he was in the league,[2] and his teams made it to the NBA Finals during his final four seasons — twice with Fort Wayne and twice with Boston. The 1957 Boston team won the NBA Championship. Phillip was alleged by one of his Fort Wayne Pistons teammates, George Yardley, to have conspired with gamblers to throw the 1955 NBA Finals to the Syracuse Nationals.[8] In the decisive seventh game, Phillip turned the ball over with three seconds remaining in the game, enabling Syracuse to win by one point, 92–91.[9] After retiring from playing basketball, he coached the St. Louis Hawks for 10 games in 1958, posting a 6–4 record before he was fired.[10] Phillip later coached the Chicago Majors of the American Basketball League.[11][12] Phillip was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1961. He was elected to the Illini Men's Basketball All-Century Team in 2004. In 2007, Phillip was voted one of the ""100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament"", recognizing his superior performance in his appearance in the tournament.[13] Phillip died at his home in Rancho Mirage, California, on April 29, 2001, aged 79.[14] Sports writer Dan Manoyan wrote a book about Phillip and his Granite City High School basketball teammates, titled Men of Granite, in 2007. A film based on the book, directed by Dwayne Johnson-Cochran, began production in 2015.[15]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/233.png

235,Rick Pitino,"September 18, 1952",,"Saint Dominic in Oyster Bay, New York",UMass,1988,2001,6,true,,"""[2, 2]""",/coaches/pitinri99c.html,"Richard Andrew Pitino (born September 18, 1952) is an American professional basketball coach who is the head coach for Panathinaikos of the Greek Basket League and EuroLeague. He is also the head coach of Greece's senior national team. He was the head coach of several teams in NCAA Division I and in the NBA, including Boston University (1978–1983), Providence College (1985–1987), the New York Knicks (1987–1989), the University of Kentucky (1989–1997), the Boston Celtics (1997–2001) and the University of Louisville (2001–2017). Pitino led Kentucky to an NCAA championship in 1996. He is the only coach to lead three different schools (Providence, Kentucky, and Louisville) to a Final Four.[5] In 2013, he was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[5] In June 2017, the NCAA suspended Pitino for five games of the upcoming 2017–18 season for his lack of oversight in an escort sex scandal involving recruits. Louisville's national championship from 2013 was eventually vacated as well. In September, Pitino was implicated in a federal investigation involving bribes to recruits, which resulted in Louisville firing him for cause. Pitino was born in New York City, New York, and was raised in Bayville, New York. He was the team captain of the St. Dominic High School basketball team in Oyster Bay, Long Island.[6] He enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1970. At a listed height of 1.83 m (6'0"") tall,[7][8] he was a standout point guard[9][10] for the Minutemen basketball team. His 329 career assists ranked tenth all-time at UMass, as of the 2009–10 season.[11] He led the team in assists as a junior and senior.[12][13] The 168 assists as a senior is the eighth-best single season total ever there.[11][14] Pitino was a freshman at the same time future NBA legend Julius Erving spent his junior (and final) year at UMass, although the two never played on the same team because freshmen were ineligible to play varsity basketball at the time. Other teammates of Pitino's include Al Skinner, who also went on to become a successful college coach, and baseball player Mike Flanagan, who went on to pitch in the major leagues and win the AL Cy Young Award in 1979. Pitino earned his degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) in 1974. College coaching assignments included Boston University, Providence College, and the University of Kentucky, and the University of Louisville. As a collegiate head coach, Pitino has compiled a 629–234 record, for a .732 winning percentage that was ranked 10th among active coaches and 29th all-time among all collegiate basketball coaches entering the 2012 season. Pitino is considered by many to be one of the first coaches to promote fully taking advantage of the 3-point shot, first adopted by the NCAA in 1987. By exploiting the 3-point shot, his teams at Kentucky in the early 1990s were known as Pitino's Bombinos, as a significant portion of the offensive points came from the 3-point shot. Even now, Pitino's teams are known for the 3-point threat and all of his teams rank towards the top in 3-point attempts per season. Many of Pitino's players and assistant coaches have gone on to become successful collegiate coaches. In total, 21 former Pitino players and coaches have become Division I head coaches, including Florida's Billy Donovan, Texas Tech's Tubby Smith, Arizona State's Herb Sendek, Cincinnati's Mick Cronin, Minnesota's Richard Pitino, Seton Hall's Kevin Willard as well as Cal State Northridge's Reggie Theus.[14] Pitino started his coaching career as a graduate assistant at the University of Hawaii in 1974, and became a full-time assistant (and interim head coach) in 1975. He was then the first assistant hired by Jim Boeheim in 1976 as Boeheim began his tenure at Syracuse University. Pitino served as Hawaii's interim head coach late in the 1975–76 season. Coach Bruce O'Neil was fired after the Rainbow Warriors' started the season 9–12. Pitino led Hawaii for their final six games, going 2–4 in the span.[15] Pitino's time at Hawaii was marred by a 1977 NCAA report on sanctions against the program. According to the report, Pitino was implicated in 8 of the 64 infractions that led the university to be placed on probation. The violations involving Pitino included providing round-trip air fare for a player between New York and Honolulu, arranging for student-athletes to receive used cars for season tickets, and handing out coupons to players for free food at McDonald's. He was also cited, along with the head coach, Bruce O'Neil, for providing misinformation to the NCAA and University of Hawaii officials. Also in 1977, the NCAA infractions committee recommended that Pitino and O'Neil be disassociated from Hawaii athletics. In 1989, Pitino would dismiss the report, saying ""I didn't make any mistakes, I don't care what anybody says.""[16] Pitino's first head coaching job came in 1978 at Boston University. In the two seasons before his arrival, the team had won a mere 17 games. Pitino led the team to its first NCAA tournament appearance in 24 years.[17] Pitino left Boston University to become an assistant coach with the New York Knicks under Hubie Brown. Pitino returned to college coaching to become head coach at Providence College in 1985. Providence had gone a dismal 11–20 in the year before he took over. Two years later, Pitino led the team to the Final Four. That Final Four team featured point guard Billy Donovan, who would go on to be an assistant coach under Pitino at the University of Kentucky and then win back-to-back national championships as head coach at the University of Florida. Donovan is currently the head coach of the Oklahoma City Thunder. After spending two years coaching in the NBA, Pitino returned to the college level again in 1989, becoming the coach at Kentucky. The Kentucky program was recovering from a major recruiting scandal brought on by former coach Eddie Sutton that left it on NCAA probation. Pitino quickly restored Kentucky's reputation and performance, leading his second school to the Final Four in the 1993 NCAA Tournament, and winning a national title in the 1996 NCAA Tournament, Kentucky's 6th NCAA Championship. The following year, Pitino's Kentucky team made it back to the national title game, losing to Arizona in overtime in the finals of the 1997 NCAA Tournament. Pitino's fast-paced teams at Kentucky were favorites of the school's fans. It was primarily at Kentucky where he implemented his signature style of full-court pressure defense. The following year, he left Kentucky for the NBA and Kentucky went on to win the 1998 national title. He would later refer to Kentucky as ""the Roman Empire of college basketball"".[18] Pitino went back to the NBA in the 1997–98 season, but returned to college—and his adopted home state—on March 21, 2001 to coach the University of Louisville following the retirement of Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum. In the 2005 season, Pitino led Louisville to their first Final Four in 19 years, and became the first men's coach in NCAA history to lead three different schools to the Final Four. Immediately following their Final Four run, several players graduated or entered the 2005 NBA Draft. The inexperience caused the Cardinals to limp into the Big East Tournament seeded 12th, and miss the NCAA tournament. They made the semifinals of the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), where they were defeated by eventual champions University of South Carolina. The 2007 Cardinal team was primarily the same team, with added freshmen. Picked to finish towards the bottom of the Big East Conference again, Pitino led them to a second-place finish, 12–4 (tied with the University of Pittsburgh, who had been beaten by the Cardinals during the regular season) in the conference standings and a first round bye in the conference tournament. Pitino implemented a 2–2–1 and 2–3 zone defense midway through the season. The 2007 team's season ended when the Cardinals lost to Texas A&M in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The 2008 Cardinals finished second in the Big East and ranked 13th in both the AP and Coaches' polls. Louisville was the third seed in the 2008 NCAA tournament's East region. They defeated Boise State, Oklahoma and Tennessee to advance to the Elite Eight, where they were defeated by North Carolina. Louisville was the top seed overall in the 2009 NCAA tournament and was planted as the first seed in the Midwest region. They defeated Morehead State, Siena and Arizona to advance to the Elite Eight, where they were defeated by Michigan State. In 2010 the Cardinals suffered a disappointing 15-point loss to their first round opponent, the California Golden Bears. In 2011, Louisville was upset by 13th-seeded Morehead State in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. In 2012, Pitino coached the Cardinals to the Big East tournament championship and a berth as a 4 seed in the West region of the NCAA tournament. The Cardinals defeated Davidson, New Mexico, and top seed Michigan State to advance to the regional final against Florida and his former player and friend Billy Donovan. The Cardinals would go on to win that game, but lost to arch-rivals and eventual national champions Kentucky in the 2012 Final Four. In 2013, Pitino led the Louisville Cardinals to their third National Championship in an 82–76 win over Michigan to become the first NCAA Division I coach in history to win a championship with two different schools. The University of Louisville self-imposed a postseason ban for the 2015–16 season amid an ongoing NCAA investigation over an escort sex scandal involving recruits between 2010 and 2014. The ban included both the ACC Tournament and the NCAA Tournament.[19][20] On June 15, 2017, the NCAA charged Pitino for failure to monitor his basketball program, which was involved in a sex-for-pay scandal. He was suspended for the first five games of the ACC season in 2017–18.[21] The NCAA announced they were considering forcing Louisville to vacate wins from the 2012–13 season, including its 2013 NCAA National Championship over Michigan—which would make Louisville the first national champion to be stripped of its title. The NCAA is also considering stripping Louisville of wins from several other seasons before and after 2012–13.[22][23] On February 20, 2018, the NCAA officially announced that the 2013 National Championship and their 2012 Final Four appearance had been vacated.[24] It was the first time the NCAA had ever vacated a men's basketball national title.[25][26] On September 26, 2017, federal prosecutors announced that the school was under investigation for an alleged ""pay for play"" involving recruits at Louisville.[27][28] The allegations state that an Adidas executive conspired to pay $100,000 to the family of a top-ranked national recruit to play at Louisville and to represent Adidas when he turned pro.[27][29] The criminal complaint does not name Louisville specifically but appears to involve the recruitment of Brian Bowen, who committed on June 3, 2017 to the school.[30][31] A day later, Louisville placed Pitino on unpaid administrative leave, while athletic director Tom Jurich was placed on paid administrative leave.[32][33][34] According to a letter interim president Greg Postel sent to Pitino, the information spelled out by prosecutors amounted to a ""material breach"" of his contract.[35] Pitino's lawyer, Steve Pence, told The Courier-Journal that as he understood it, Pitino had been ""effectively fired."" Under the terms of Pitino's contract, Louisville was required to give him 10 days' notice and ""an opportunity to be heard"" before firing him for cause.[36] According to CBS Sports' Gary Parrish, school officials did not intend for Pitino to ever return to the sidelines again, and planned to cut ties with him as soon as they could legally do so.[37] On October 2, the board of the University of Louisville Athletic Association voted to formally begin the process of firing Pitino for cause. On the same day, Pitino, through his lawyer, claimed that Louisville officials should have given him 10 days notice and a chance to respond before placing him on leave.[38] On October 16, the ULAA board voted unanimously to fire Pitino for cause.[39] Pitino became head coach of the New York Knicks on July 14, 1987.[40] The year before he arrived, the team had only won 24 games. In just two years, Pitino led the Knicks to their first division title in nearly twenty years.[17] He resigned from the Knicks on May 30, 1989.[41][42] Pitino returned to the NBA in 1997 when the Boston Celtics hired him as head coach on May 6, 1997.[43] He resigned on January 8, 2001.[44] His NBA coaching experience often demonstrated a deep frustration with the dynamics of the league, especially in Boston, where he amassed a 102–146 record from 1997 to 2001. After being beaten by the Toronto Raptors on March 1, 2000, on a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter, Pitino's frustration reached critical mass as he addressed the press. Referring to the expectations of Boston Celtics fans and media, Pitino challenged each of them to let go of the past and focus on the future: Pitino struggled in Boston, and statistics like 1998–99's 19–31 record made him little better in the eyes of many Boston fans than his inexperienced predecessor, M. L. Carr. Pitino's remarks became a cornerstone of Celtics lore, and has served as a metaphor for other sports franchises and their inability to relive past successes.[46] Pitino himself reprised the speech in a tongue-in-cheek manner at Louisville in November 2005, challenging his freshmen players to play as tough as past seniors and drawing laughter from sportswriters in a postgame press conference. During his time in Boston, he also served as team president, with complete control over basketball operations. On December 26, 2018, Panathinaikos announced Pitino as the head coach of the team until the end of the season, marking his debut in the EuroLeague.[47] With him on the bench, Panathinaikos transformed into a whole different team. On February 17, 2019, they won the 2018–19 Greek Cup against PAOK in the final.[48] In the EuroLeague Regular Season, they managed to make an impressive comeback after a 6 wins - 8 losses start, to finish in sixth place and reach the playoffs, after they registered ten wins in their last sixteen games. In the EuroLeague Playoffs, Panathinaikos fell for a second consecutive year against defending champions Real Madrid, thus failing to qualify for the 2019 EuroLeague Final Four. The season ended with Panathinaikos winning the 2018–19 Greek Basket League's season championship, after they swept Promitheas Patras 3–0 in the League's Finals.[49] After the season, Panathinaikos made an offer to coach Pitino to extend his stay, and although he showed willingness to stay in Greece for another season, he declined the offer, due to a family matter.[50] On November 26, 2019, Pitino was rehired by Panathinaikos as the team's head coach, after overcoming the family matter that had previously kept him away from coaching. He signed a ​1 1⁄2-year contract, thus becoming the team's head coach until the summer of 2021.[51][52][53] On December 20, 2010, Pitino was hired as head coach of the senior Puerto Rico national team. On April 29, 2011, it was announced that Pitino would not coach the Puerto Rico national team, due to scheduling conflicts and NCAA regulations disallowing it. Pitino coached the Puerto Rican national team at the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship, in Mexico City, Mexico.[54] They finished the tournament in 5th place. On November 8, 2019, Pitino was hired as head coach of Greece's senior national team.[55][56][57] The Hellenic Basketball Federation announced that Pitino would be Greece's head coach at the 2020 FIBA Victoria Olympic Qualifying Tournament and the 2020 Summer Olympics, should Greece qualify, while Thanasis Skourtopoulos would serve as Greece's head coach for the 2021 EuroBasket qualification tournament. Pitino married his wife, the former Joanne Minardi, in 1976. They have five living children: Michael, Christopher, Richard Jr. (now the head coach at Minnesota),[58] Ryan and Jacqueline. Another son, Daniel, died in 1987 from congenital heart failure at the age of six months. Rick and Joanne established the Daniel Pitino Foundation (along with a Daniel Pitino shelter in Owensboro, Kentucky) in his memory, which has raised millions of dollars for children in need.[59] Their son's death was not the last tragedy for Rick and Joanne. Both were especially hard-hit by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as Joanne's brother and Rick's closest friend, Billy Minardi, was working as a bond trader for Cantor Fitzgerald on the 105th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center when it was struck by American Airlines Flight 11. Since 2002, the University of Louisville has designated a December home game as the Billy Minardi Classic, and the university named a dorm on campus as ""Billy Minardi Hall."" Only a few months earlier, another brother-in-law of Rick, Don Vogt, was killed after being hit by a New York City cab.[6] With Eric Crawford, Pitino has written a book, The One-Day Contract: How to Add Value to Every Minute of Your Life. Pitino is the author of a motivational self-help book (and audio recording) named Success is a Choice. He published an autobiography in 1988 entitled Born to Coach, describing his life up until his time with the Knicks. His most recent book Rebound Rules, was the top seller at the 2008 Kentucky Book Fair. In 2005, Pitino's Louisville team posted a tie for the most single season wins in school history (33)—since surpassed by the 35 total wins by the 2013 NCAA title-winning Cardinals team—while he is one of two men's coaches in NCAA history to lead three separate schools (Providence, Kentucky, and Louisville) to the Final Four. The other coach is his in-state rival, John Calipari (UMass Amherst, Memphis, Kentucky), though both final four appearances at UMass and Memphis were later vacated. As of 2015, Pitino's .746 winning percentage in 72 NCAA Tournament games ranked fourth among all coaches, third among active coaches.[60] Beyond basketball, Pitino has been involved in the sport of Thoroughbred horse racing as the lead partner in Celtic Pride Stable and the Ol Memorial Stable. Among his notable horses have been A P Valentine and Halory Hunter.[61] Pitino, through the stable name of RAP Racing, owns a 5 percent share of Goldencents. Goldencents, who won the $750,000 2013 Santa Anita Derby, ran in the 2013 Kentucky Derby and finished 17th despite having 8/1 odds of winning.[62] On April 18, 2009, Pitino announced that he was a target of an extortion attempt.[63] On April 24, Karen Cunagin Sypher, the wife of Louisville equipment manager Tim Sypher, was arraigned and charged in US District Court with extortion and lying to federal agents.[64][65] On August 11, Pitino admitted to having engaged in sexual relations with Cunagin on August 1, 2003 in Porcini, a Louisville restaurant. Several weeks later, Cunagin told Pitino that she was pregnant and wanted to have an abortion, but she did not have health insurance. Pitino paid her $3,000 for an abortion.[66] During the trial, Pitino downplayed the pair's sexual escapade. The complete act took, the coach testified, ""No more than 15 seconds."" In addition, Cunagin, who was convicted for extortion and lying to federal agents,[67] claimed that her estranged husband, Tim Sypher, was paid to marry her.[68] At a press conference on August 12, Pitino made a statement, in which he apologized for his indiscretion and stated that he would remain as coach.[69] While Pitino's contract allowed for his firing for ""acts of moral depravity or misconduct that damages the university's reputation,"" University of Louisville president James Ramsey announced on August 13 that Pitino would be retained in his position.[66] On August 26, Pitino demanded in a press conference that the media stop ""reporting these lies."" The conference was called even though University of Louisville officials advised that he was not obligated to respond.[68] On August 6, 2010, a federal district court found Cunagin guilty of extortion and lying to federal agents, carrying a maximum penalty of 26 years in prison. She was eventually sentenced to 87 months in prison, and was released to a halfway house in January 2017.[70] After her conviction, Cunagin hired new attorneys and accused the judge, prosecutors, her former attorneys, and Pitino of taking part in a conspiracy to ensure she was found guilty, though she later expressed ""exceptional remorse and contrition regarding her commission of her offenses.""[70] ^Kentucky was ineligible for both the NCAA and SEC Tournaments in 1990 and 1991 due to sanctions from the Eddie Sutton-era. ^^Kentucky finished first in the SEC standings. However, due to their probation, they were ineligible for the regular-season title; it was awarded to second-place LSU instead. ^^^Pitino did not coach in one win (January 28, 2004 vs. Houston) due to medical leave, but is credited with the victory. ^^^^Louisville self-imposed ineligibility for the 2015–16 postseason due to an ongoing NCAA investigation.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/235.png

As a player in the NBA, Pollard was considered one of the best forwards in the 1950s and was known for his leaping ability,[1] earning him the nickname ""The Kangaroo Kid"". A five-time NBA champion and four-time NBA All-Star, Pollard spent his entire eight-year professional career with the Minneapolis Lakers. Pollard was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978.[2] He has also been inducted into the Bay Area Hall of Fame, Stanford Hall of Fame, and Pac-12 Hall of Honor. Pollard attended Oakland Technical High School in his hometown of Oakland, California. He led the school's basketball team to three consecutive conference titles from 1937–38 to 1939–40. He averaged 19.8 points per game in his senior year, setting a school record.[3] Pollard was recruited to Stanford University by former Stanford star and future Hall of Famer, Hank Luisetti.[4] Pollard played for the Stanford Indians for two seasons, under head coach Everett Dean. During his sophomore season, he was a key member of the team's 1942 national championship team, but, due to illness, he did not play in the championship game.[3] Pollard's college career was ended early due to World War II, and he served with the United States Coast Guard from 1942 to 1946. During his service, he starred with the Coast Guard basketball team in Alameda, winning a Northern California title in 1943 and the Service League championship in 1946.[3] Pollard went on to graduate from the University of Minnesota in 1954.[4] After World War II, Pollard played amateur basketball for one season with the San Diego Dons of the Amateur Athletic Union. The following season, he played for the Oakland Bittners in the same league. He led the AAU in scoring and earned Most Valuable Player honors both years. His teams were runners-up in the national AAU tournament both seasons.[3] Pollard also played amateur baseball for Jordan, Minnesota's Town Team baseball club, during his NBA career. He was reputed to be ""a good pitcher and a powerful hitter."" It was there that Pollard famously ""hit a ball that didn't stop until it got to Chicago"", because it landed in a gondola car in a freight train passing by the ballpark.[5] Pollard began his professional basketball career in 1947 after signing with the Minneapolis Lakers while the team was a part of the National Basketball League. On the team, Pollard was a member of a future Hall of Fame frontcourt alongside center George Mikan and power forward Vern Mikkelsen, as well as fellow Hall of Famer Slater Martin at shooting guard. Led by coach John Kundla, this core group of players have been called the ""first legacy in the history of professional basketball"".[3] The Lakers won the NBL championship in 1948, the BAA championship in 1949, and four NBA championships in 1950, 1952, 1953 and 1954. Pollard was a four-time NBA All-Star, and was named to the All-NBA First Team in 1949 and 1950, and Second Team in 1952 and 1954. Pollard was renowned for his tremendous leaping ability, and subsequently earned the nickname ""The Kangaroo Kid"". He could reportedly touch the top of the backboard and dunk from the foul line,[2] being one of the few players in his era who was capable of dunking a basketball.[4] Pollard was also known for his corner jumpshot,[3] and was a respected player and teammate.[2] In 1952, the Basketball Association of America selected Pollard as the best player of the era.[2] Pollard retired from playing basketball after eight seasons, and finished with career averages of 13.2 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game.[6] Pollard immediately moved into coaching after retiring, taking the head coach position at La Salle University for the Explorers men's basketball team in 1955. Over three seasons with the team, Pollard compiled a record of 48–28.[3] Pollard was named interim head coach of the Lakers midway through the 1959–60 NBA season on January 2, 1960,[6] and recorded a 14–25 record.[7] He was named the head coach of the newly established Chicago Packers in 1961, and managed an 18–62 record in the team's first NBA season.[7] He moved to the American Basketball Association for the league's inaugural season in 1967, and coached the Minnesota Muskies, which relocated to Miami and became the Miami Floridians the following season. He was fired by the team midway through the 1969–70 season.[7] Pollard spent his final years of coaching at Florida Atlantic University with the Owls men's basketball team, which he coached for two seasons.[7]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/236.png
237,Gregg Popovich,"January 28, 1949",,"Merrilville in Merrilville, Indiana",United States Air Force Academy,1997,2020,24,false,,"""[2]""",/coaches/popovgr99c.html,"Gregg Charles Popovich (born January 28, 1949) is an American professional basketball coach and general manager. He is the head coach and President of the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and head coach of USA national team. Taking over as coach of the Spurs in 1996, Popovich is the longest tenured active coach in both the NBA and all major sports leagues in the United States. He is often called ""Coach Pop"" or simply ""Pop.""[1][2] Popovich has the most wins in NBA history (regular season and playoffs), surpassing Lenny Wilkens and Don Nelson on April 13, 2019. He has led the Spurs to a winning record in each of his 22 full seasons as head coach, surpassing Phil Jackson for the most consecutive winning seasons in NBA history. During his tenure, the Spurs have had a winning record against every other NBA team. Popovich has led the Spurs to all five of their NBA titles, and is one of only five coaches in NBA history to win five titles.[3][4] Popovich was born in East Chicago, Indiana, on January 28, 1949, to a Serbian father and a Croatian mother.[5][6] He started his basketball career playing Biddy Basketball and was on the 1960 Gary Biddy Basketball All-Star Team that finished third in the World Tournament, held at Gary's Memorial Auditorium. He attended Merrillville High School and graduated in 1970 from the United States Air Force Academy. He played basketball for four seasons at the Academy and in his senior year was the team captain and the leading scorer.[7] He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Soviet Studies, and underwent Air Force intelligence training.[8] He later earned a master's degree in physical education and sports sciences at the University of Denver.[9] At one point, Popovich considered a career with the Central Intelligence Agency.[10][11] Popovich served five years of required active duty in the United States Air Force, during which he toured Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union with the U.S. Armed Forces Basketball Team.[11] In 1972 he was selected as captain of the Armed Forces Team, which won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) championship. This earned him an invitation to the 1972 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team trials.[12] Popovich returned to the Air Force Academy as an assistant coach in 1973 under head coach Hank Egan, a position he held for six years. Egan later became an assistant coach under Popovich for the San Antonio Spurs. During his time with the coaching staff of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Popovich attended the University of Denver and earned his master's degree in physical education and sports sciences. In 1979, he was named the head basketball coach of Pomona-Pitzer's men's team. Popovich coached Pomona-Pitzer men's basketball from 1979 to 1988, leading the team to its first outright title in 68 years. During his time as head coach at Pomona-Pitzer, Popovich became a disciple and later a close friend of head coach Larry Brown at the University of Kansas. Popovich took off the 1985–86 season at Pomona-Pitzer to become a volunteer assistant at Kansas, where he could study directly under Brown. Popovich returned to Pomona-Pitzer and resumed his duties as head coach the next season. Following the 1987–88 season, Popovich joined Brown as the lead assistant coach for the Spurs. From 1988 to 1992, Popovich was Brown's top assistant, until the entire staff, including R. C. Buford, Alvin Gentry and Ed Manning, were fired by owner Red McCombs. Popovich moved to the Golden State Warriors for a brief stint in 1992, serving as an assistant under future Hall of Famer Don Nelson and bringing with him Avery Johnson, who had been cut by the Spurs. In 1994, Popovich returned to San Antonio as the general manager and Vice President of Basketball Operations after Peter Holt purchased the team. Popovich's first move was to sign Avery Johnson as the team's starting point guard. Another one of Popovich's early moves in San Antonio was to trade Dennis Rodman to the Chicago Bulls for Will Perdue.[13] Rodman was not fond of Popovich, as Rodman said in his first book Bad As I Wanna Be.[14] After the Spurs had a 3–15 start in the 1996–97 season, with David Robinson sidelined with a preseason back injury, Popovich fired coach Bob Hill and named himself head coach. Robinson then broke his foot after only six games and was lost for the season. Sean Elliott was also limited to 39 games due to injury, and Chuck Person missed the entire season. With a reduced roster that included an aging Dominique Wilkins, the Spurs struggled and won only 17 games for the remainder of the season for an overall record of 20–62. The Spurs' disastrous season allowed them the first overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft, which they used to draft Tim Duncan out of Wake Forest University. The Spurs blossomed as the 6'11"" Duncan teamed up with the 7'1"" Robinson in a ""Twin Tower"" offense and defense for several years. After recovering to win 56 games in 1997-1998 (Popovich's first full year as coach), the Spurs won their first NBA title in 1999. In 2002, Popovich relinquished his position as general manager to R. C. Buford, who had served as the team's head scout. Popovich and Buford were both given their starts in the NBA in 1988 as assistants on Brown's coaching staff with the Spurs. Popovich has won five championships with the Spurs—1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014. He was named NBA Coach of the Year in 2003, 2012, and 2014. On April 4, 2008, Popovich returned to the U.S. Air Force Academy to receive the academy's award of Distinguished Graduate. Despite his four NBA titles at the time, Popovich said it was the most meaningful award he had ever received.[15] On May 2, 2012, Popovich won his second Coach of the Year Award for the 2011–12 NBA season.[16] On November 29, 2012, Popovich sat out starters Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Danny Green for a nationally televised game against the Miami Heat. Popovich has frequently sat out his starters on road trips over the years to ensure they have enough rest for the playoffs; the Spurs' roster was among the oldest in the league. NBA commissioner David Stern was outraged by this and said on the night of the game that it was ""unacceptable,"" and ""substantial sanctions [would] be forthcoming.""[17] On November 30, Stern fined the Spurs $250,000 for what he called ""a disservice to the league and the fans."" According to Stern, Popovich had not informed the Heat, the league or the media in a suitable time frame that the four players were not making the trip to Miami.[18] Stern's decision was criticized by commentators such as Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports, who said, ""Stern doesn't care about the realities of his league, just the appearances. To him, the appearance on Thursday night was that Popovich had tried to embarrass him on national television and that's why the commissioner tossed that tantrum.""[19] Popovich led the Spurs to the 2013 NBA Finals to face the Miami Heat. The series lasted seven games, but the Spurs had their first ever Finals loss. On April 22, 2014, Popovich was awarded the Red Auerbach Trophy as he won the NBA Coach of the Year for the third time.[20] He also won his fifth NBA championship with San Antonio that season, beating the Heat 4–1 in the Finals. On February 9, 2015, Popovich became the ninth coach in NBA history to win 1,000 games when the Spurs defeated the Indiana Pacers 95–93. He and Jerry Sloan are the only two coaches in NBA history to win 1,000 games with one franchise. On August 1, 2015, Popovich served as Team Africa's head coach at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game.[21] In the 2015–16 season, Popovich led the Spurs to a franchise high 67 wins, but he and the team lost in the conference semifinals against the Oklahoma City Thunder in six games. On February 4, 2017, Popovich recorded his 1,128th win with one franchise, surpassing Sloan.[22] On April 13, 2019, Popovich surpassed Lenny Wilkens and became the all-time winningest coach in NBA history with his 1,413th win.[23] Popovich said he supports the comments from NBA commissioner Adam Silver surrounding the controversy with the NBA and China.[24][25] Popovich served on the coaching staff for the U.S. national team during the 2002 FIBA World Championship (assisting George Karl),[26] during the 2003 FIBA America Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournament, and during the 2004 Olympic Games, where the U.S. won a bronze medal. On October 23, 2015, Popovich was named head coach of the U.S. men's national team, taking over from Mike Krzyzewski after the 2016 Olympic Games.[27] On multiple occasions, Popovich has spoken out on behalf of social justice issues, including in support of the Women's March. He has also repeatedly criticized the behavior of President Donald Trump.[28][29][30][8][31] Popovich was married to Erin Popovich until her death on April 18, 2018; the couple had two children.[32] Popovich has spent considerable time and money working with several charities and nonprofits the likes of San Antonio Food Bank and Innocence Project. He also took part in Shoes That Fit, an organization that aims to deliver shoes to more than 200 students at Gates Elementary School affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.[33] Popovich is helping raise funds for J/P HRO, a disaster relief program that operates in Haiti, and various disaster relief organizations in the U.S. and Caribbean.[34]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/237.png

He is currently the head men's basketball coach at the University of Portland. A native of Wisconsin, he played college basketball at the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point before being drafted 24th by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1985 NBA draft. In Portland, he played ten seasons with two All-Star Game appearances. Porter spent 17 years in the NBA as a player. Following his retirement as a player in 2002, he began coaching in the league and has twice been a head coach, first with his hometown Milwaukee Bucks, and then with the Phoenix Suns up until February 16, 2009. He was the alumni ambassador for Portland Trail Blazers.[1] Porter was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on April 8, 1963. Porter played prep basketball, as a forward, at Milwaukee's South Division High School. Porter attended college at the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point (The Pointers), a Division III school. He played under head coach Dick Bennett, and with Brad Soderberg (who later became the head coach at Saint Louis University). In four seasons at Stevens Point, Porter averaged 13.5 points, 3.8 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game, and shot 58.9 percent from the floor.[2] As a junior, he averaged 18.8 points while shooting over 65 percent from the floor.[3] Twice with the Pointers, as both a junior and a senior, he was named an NAIA First-Team All-American. As a junior, he was named the NAIA ""Player of the Year"", and in the 1984 NAIA tournament, he was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player even though the Pointers lost the national championship to Fort Hays State.[4] After the 1984 tournament, Porter was the only NAIA player to be invited to the 1984 U.S. Olympic Team trials – the team included Patrick Ewing, Michael Jordan, Sam Perkins, Wayman Tisdale, Chris Mullin, and Steve Alford – 72 players were invited to the trials, led by head coach Bob Knight. At the trials he said: ""I'm sure a lot of guys might have been surprised to see me here, I didn't even expect to get invited. This competition is a whole notch up from what I'm used to. I feel kind of in awe"".[5] Porter made it to the final 20 (even though he had the chicken pox[6]), but on a team that was heavy on guards (Jordan, Alford, Vern Fleming, Alvin Robertson, and Leon Wood), Porter was cut on May 13, 1984 along with Charles Barkley and John Stockton. After the Olympic trials NBA scouts began to notice Porter for his ""tight defensive play, nonstop hustle and deft shooting touch"". He commented: ""I wasn't much good in high school, so the big schools didn't come after me. But I guess I've improved a lot at Point"". After three seasons at shooting guard (or 2G) he moved to the point guard (PG) position.[3] Following his senior season, where he averaged 19.7 points and 4.3 assists per-game, he was the only Division III player named to the National Association of Basketball Coaches-Valvoline All-America Game.[7] He was also the only NAIA player named to the Aloha Basketball All-Star Classic, where he was named to the all-tournament team (along with Detlef Schrempf, Harold Keeling, Xavier McDaniel, and Joe Dumars), and as ""top defensive player"" and co-MVP.[8][9] Porter returned to Wisconsin–Stevens Point to finish his degree in communications, obtained in 1993, with an emphasis in television and radio.[10] He was awarded a Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1999.[11] Going into the 1985 NBA draft, the Chicago Bulls,[12] Atlanta Hawks,[13] Golden State Warriors,[14] and San Antonio Spurs,[15] all looked to draft Porter. Most pundits, including Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe, projected him going to the Houston Rockets with the 19th pick in the draft,[16] while Jan Hubbard of the Dallas Morning News had him going to the Detroit Pistons with the number 18 pick.[17] And he was considered the second best choice at point guard, behind Sam Vincent, out of Michigan State.[18] On June 18, 1985 the Portland Trail Blazers selected Porter with the 24th overall pick in the NBA Draft. Porter slipped from the projected 18th or 19th pick while other guards, Joe Dumars (18th by the Pistons), Steve Harris (19th by the Rockets), and Sam Vincent (20th by the Celtics), went ahead of him. On February 5, 1987, Porter recorded his first career triple-double after recording 18 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a 105–104 win over the visiting Los Angeles Lakers.[19] A month later, Porter recorded his second career triple-double after recording 14 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a losing effort against the Seattle SuperSonics.[20] During the 1987–88 season, Porter averaged 10.1 assists per game, thus making him the only player in the Trail Blazers' franchise history to average double-digit in assists in a season. Porter scored a career-high 40 points to go along with six rebounds and 12 assists in a 121–116 win over the Golden State Warriors on March 18, 1988.[21] On April 14, Porter recorded 25 points and a career-high 19 assists in a 128–123 road win against the Utah Jazz.[22] In Game 2 of the 1990 NBA Finals, Porter became the first Trail Blazers' player to record double-digit assists in a single game, after recording 10 assists in a 106–105 overtime win against the Pistons.[23] During his decade-long tenure in Portland, Porter went to the NBA Finals twice, back in 1990 and 1992. He was the recipient of the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award in 1993, and remains as the Trail Blazers' all-time assists leader with 5,319. Porter signed as a free agent with the Minnesota Timberwolves prior to the 1995–96 season and helped the Wolves clinch their first-ever playoff berth in 1996–97 and their first winning season the following year. He signed with the Miami Heat before the 1998–99 season. On February 9, 1999, he scored a season-high 21 points to go along with three assists and three steals in a 108–101 home loss to the Boston Celtics.[24] He signed with the San Antonio Spurs prior to the 1999–2000 season. He retired after the 2001–02 season, having never been traded during his NBA career. Porter's teams compiled a record of 815–547 (.598) during his career, and only once failed to make the postseason. In 1,274 career games, Porter averaged 12.2 points, 5.6 assists and 1.24 steals during a career that included two All-Star berths (1991, 1993), two trips to the NBA Finals (1990, 1992) and 15,586 career points. He is 12th on the NBA's all-time assist list (7,160). Porter has played for five of the top 36 coaches (games won) in NBA history: Pat Riley (1,210), Rick Adelman (945), Jack Ramsay (864), Gregg Popovich (797) and Flip Saunders (636). On December 16, 2008, the Trail Blazers retired Porter's #30 jersey.[25] Porter spent the 2002–03 season as an assistant coach with the Sacramento Kings, his first season in coaching.[26] On August 6, 2003, the Milwaukee native was hired as head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks.[27] He was the eighth head coach in franchise history. He coached the Bucks for two years, leading a team which was expected to wind up in the playoffs after landing in the NBA draft lottery. However, the Bucks failed to make the playoffs the next season, and Porter was released during the 2005 offseason. In his time away from the game, he coached his sons fifth grade basketball team to an undefeated season. After a year away from the professional game, Porter joined the Detroit Pistons staff as an assistant coach for the 2006–07 season.[28] On June 9, 2008, Porter was named the 13th head coach of the Phoenix Suns, succeeding Mike D'Antoni.[29] On February 16, 2009, the Suns fired him after 51 games, and replaced him with assistant Alvin Gentry. The Suns had a 28–23 record, ninth in the Western Conference, with Porter.[30] On December 6, 2011, he was hired as an assistant coach by the Minnesota Timberwolves under Rick Adelman.[31] On January 8, 2013, the Timberwolves announced that Porter would be acting head coach while Adelman was not with the team due to family issues.[32][33] On April 2, 2016, it was announced that Porter was hired as the head men's basketball coach by the University of Portland.[34] In 2006 Porter led an investor group attempting to purchase the then-troubled Portland Trail Blazers from owner Paul Allen. Porter teamed with Rob Kremer, a local talk-show personality and former investment banker, and Todd Stucky, a local businessman and longtime Porter friend, to raise the necessary capital to buy the team. Porter's buyout team was joined by George Postolos, who had recently resigned as CEO of the Houston Rockets, and who brought with him a lead investor to round out the Porter investor team package. After the 2006 draft in which the Trail Blazers significantly upgraded their personnel through a series of trades by Blazer executive Kevin Pritchard, Paul Allen appeared to renew his interest in the team, and removed it from the market. Porter joined the Trail Blazers television broadcasting team before the start of the 2010–2011 season.[35] Porter, the youngest of six children, is an avid golfer. He and his wife Susie have three children – Brianna, Franklin and Malcolm. The family resides in the Portland area. Throughout his career, Porter has been active with the Boys and Girls Club and is a member of the organization's Hall of Fame.

Pritchard played college basketball for the University of Kansas, where he was the starting point guard on the Jayhawks team that defeated the Oklahoma Sooners for the 1988 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship.[citation needed] Pritchard was drafted by the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association as the 34th overall pick in 1990. He had a six-year NBA career spanning five teams: the Warriors, the Boston Celtics, the Philadelphia 76ers, the Miami Heat, and the Washington Bullets. He was first player signed to the Vancouver Grizzlies in 1995, although he was released before getting an opportunity to play a game for them.[citation needed] Pritchard's playing career also included a stint with Caceres C.B. in Spain, Pfizer Reggio Calabria in Italy in 1993-1994, and Bayer Leverkusen in Germany 1996-1997. He retired from playing in 1998. After a year working outside of basketball, Pritchard became the coach and general manager of the Kansas City Knights of the ABA, which he led to a championship in 2002. Later, he was hired by San Antonio Spurs general manager R. C. Buford to be a scout in the Spurs' organization, and two years later was hired by the Portland Trail Blazers as director of player personnel. In 2005, when the Trail Blazers fired head coach Maurice Cheeks, they named Pritchard as his interim replacement. In the 2006 off-season, the team fired John Nash, giving Steve Patterson the dual role of general manager and president, while Pritchard was promoted to assistant general manager. In 2007, Patterson resigned, and on March 29, Pritchard was named as the team's general manager. In December 2008, the Blazers attempted to block other NBA teams from signing Darius Miles solely for the purpose of negatively impacting the Blazers' salary cap situation. Miles ended up signing with the Memphis Grizzlies.[3] In the summer of 2009, the Blazers added to their core of young talent by signing veterans Andre Miller and Juwan Howard to free agent contracts.[4][5] The 2009-10 Blazers suffered a historic level of injuries to key players, yet the team still won 50 games and returned to the playoffs. Pritchard was relieved of his general manager duties on June 24, 2010. About one hour before the 2010 NBA Draft, Kevin Pritchard was notified by Paul Allen that he had been fired, but wanted to make it clear that he needed to stay for the draft. Pritchard made a trade and two draft selections, which satisfied Trail Blazer team officials.[6] Many people expected the release of Pritchard to take place, as they felt the firing of Tom Penn, who was the assistant general manager, was a ""drive-by"" warning for Pritchard.[7] Joe Freeman, of The Oregonian newspaper, broke this story early in the four o'clock hour of draft day to ""Trail Blazers Courtside"",[8] an official Trail Blazer show offering live draft day coverage. It was reported that the Trail Blazers officials told the show's hosts to stop talking about Pritchard immediately.[9] Allen's plan was to announce the firing the next day, but word got to the media and the Blazers were forced to address the situation.[10] In a press conference after, team President Larry Miller fielded all questions. No reasons were given as to why Pritchard was fired. Pritchard authored an open letter to Blazers' fans in which he thanked Paul Allen and the Blazers for the opportunity to help turn around the team.[11] In July 2011, Pritchard joined the Indiana Pacers to become their director of player personnel.[12] Later on, he was promoted to general manager in June 2012 to replace David Morway. On May 1, 2017, Pritchard took over the role of president of basketball operations, while retaining his general manager duties, when Larry Bird resigned.[13]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/240.png

The team went 1–1 in these games with a loss against Cleveland and a win against Miami and LeBron James. The Nets had previously lost 13 straight games against the Heat before Prunty ended the streak in his first game against them. Kidd left the Nets for the Milwaukee Bucks in 2014 and Prunty joined the staff there. On December 20, 2015, Prunty was named the interim head coach for 17 games as Kidd underwent hip surgery.[15] The team went 8–9 during that time,[16] a significant improvement after beginning the season 10–18. With Prunty at the helm, the team played at a faster pace with a greater emphasis on offensive rebounds, which resulted in a much improved offensive rating.[17] The Bucks reached the playoffs during the 2016–17 season, losing to the Toronto Raptors in six games. After beginning the 2017–18 season with a disappointing 23–22 record and falling to the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference, head coach Kidd was fired,[18] and Prunty was named interim head coach on January 22, 2018 before they began their game against the Phoenix Suns.[19] After winning that game, for the rest of the season onward, the Bucks would improve just enough to gain the 7th seed of the Eastern Conference in the 2018 NBA Playoffs, facing against the Boston Celtics in the first round. While Milwaukee would be competitive throughout the series, they would ultimately lose the first round 4–3. Prunty would remain with the Bucks until May 17, when Mike Budenholzer would be named his replacement. On June 4, 2018, it was announced that Prunty would join the Phoenix Suns as their leading assistant coach.[20] He along with other Suns assistants were relieved of their duties in April 2019, following the firing of head coach Igor Kokoškov.[21] In those 23 seasons, Prunty's teams have amassed a record of 1,027-811 (.559). Joe Prunty was named the head coach of the Great Britain men's national basketball team in June 2013 after an extensive interview process following Chris Finch's resignation. The choice was initially somewhat controversial as Prunty had little previous international coaching experience.[22] Prunty's first campaign as GB head coach was summer 2013. Despite being without top players Luol Deng, Ben Gordon, Joel Freeland, and Pops Mensah-Bonsu, Prunty began his tenure with a 61–55 win over Puerto Rico in an International Test Match at The Copper Box Arena, London. The team went on to upset Israel in their first game of Eurobasket 2013, earning a dramatic overtime victory.[23] However, Great Britain ended the group phase with a 2–3 record, not good enough to advance. Because of this result, UK Sport cut its funding for the team. Despite the future of the British national team looking bleak due to the budget constraints, Prunty stayed on as coach as the team attempted to qualify for Eurobasket 2015. The cut in funding meant the team could not afford the insurance costs required to recruit top players, had to cancel training camp, and required players to sleep in dorm beds and live on £15 a day.[24] After losses to Bosnia and Iceland, the team failed to qualify for the tournament.[25] With funding from Sport England,[26] the team set out in 2016 to qualify for Eurobasket 2017. Their 3–3 record in their group was good enough to ensure that they were one of the four top runners-up in all of the qualifying groups. For the 2017 tournament, they ended up in the very tough Group D, facing off against Belgium, Latvia, Russia, Serbia, and hosts Turkey.[27] Despite keeping most of the games close, the team went 0–5 at the tournament and were not able to advance to the knockout phase.[28] Due to changes from FIBA in the qualifying process for the upcoming World Cup and Olympics that conflict with the NBA,[29] Prunty was forced to step down as head coach of the Great Britain men's national team after Eurobasket 2017. Under Prunty's tenure, the team went 11–37 with a 5–15 record in competitive games.[30] Despite the lackluster record, Prunty is credited with creating a close communication culture within the team that kept the program afloat during difficult times, with at least one player on record saying he would not have considered playing for the team without Prunty as head coach.[31][32] Prunty and his wife Laura have been married since 2002. They have two children, Luke and Emma.[4][33]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/241.png
242,Kurt Rambis,"February 25, 1958",,"Cupertino in Cupertino, California",Santa Clara,1999,2016,4,true,,"""[1, 1, 2]""",/coaches/rambiku01c.html,"Darrell Kurt Rambis (born February 25, 1958) is a Greek-American former basketball player and coach who is a senior basketball adviser for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). As a player, he won four NBA championships while playing power forward for the Lakers. Rambis was a key member of the Showtime era Lakers and was extremely popular[1] for his hard-nosed blue collar play.[2] With his trademark black horned rim glasses, Rambis complemented the flashy Hollywood style of the Showtime era Lakers.[1] Rambis played college basketball for the Santa Clara Broncos. As a senior in 1980, he was named the player of the year in the West Coast Conference (WCC). Rambis was selected by the New York Knicks in the third round of the 1980 NBA draft, but began his career in Greece with AEK Athens before joining the Lakers. He also played for the Charlotte Hornets, Phoenix Suns, and Sacramento Kings. Rambis became a coach, and has served as head coach for the Lakers, Minnesota Timberwolves and the Knicks. He also won two league championships as an assistant coach with the Lakers. Rambis was born in Terre Haute, Indiana.[3] His family moved to Cupertino, California in his preschool years; his number is retired at Cupertino High School. He graduated from Santa Clara University, where he played from 1976 to 1980, becoming its second leading rebounder and all-time leading scorer with 1,736 points. During his Santa Clara years he was awarded the WCC Freshman of the Year and Conference Player of the Year as a senior. His jersey #34 was retired on December 29, 2008.[4] Rambis was drafted by the New York Knicks as the 58th pick in the 1980 NBA draft, but he was subsequently waived by the Knicks. He played in Greece in the Greek League for the club AEK Athens, under the name Kyriakos Rambidis.[5] Being of Greek descent,[6] he also acquired Greek citizenship.[5] AEK won the Greek Cup in 1981. He was re-signed by the Knicks in 1981 but never played a game for them.[7] His success as an NBA player started when he was signed as a free agent by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1981. Rambis spent most of his 14 seasons in the NBA with the Lakers, winning championships in 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988 as part of their Showtime teams. During his playing days, Rambis was a favorite among the Lakers fans because of his status as an overachieving underdog and ultimate team-player. Known for his defensive and rebounding skills, he was remembered in Los Angeles for his all-out effort and willingness to do the ""dirty work"" that many players do not embrace. Rambis usually wore a thick moustache and thick-rimmed black glasses, prompting Lakers announcer Chick Hearn to nickname him ""Superman"" (in reference to the character's alter ego, Clark Kent).[8] Rambis also played for the Charlotte Hornets, Phoenix Suns, and Sacramento Kings before returning to the Lakers in 1993. Rambis retired as a player with the Lakers in 1995. Rambis began working as a special assistant coach for the Lakers in 1994, but eventually returned to the active playing roster. He was waived at the beginning of the 1995–96 season, and resumed his role as an assistant.[9] He served as head coach of the Lakers during the 1999 ""lockout season"" after coach Del Harris was fired. He achieved moderate success, registering a 24–13 record in the regular season before being swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the 1999 Western Conference Semifinals. When Phil Jackson was hired as head coach, Rambis served as the Lakers' assistant general manager. He later became an assistant coach under Jackson between 2001 and 2004, helping the Lakers reach the 2002 and the 2004 NBA Finals, with Los Angeles winning a title in the former series. He was hired again as an assistant in 2005, along with former player Brian Shaw,[10] helping the Lakers to another pair of finals in 2008 and 2009. The Lakers won in the latter attempt. In 2007, Rambis interviewed for the Sacramento Kings' coaching job. He was a finalist again in 2009 to coach the Kings, and after serious discussions, he was offered the job, but he wanted more than a two-year contract and more money than was offered, so he turned down the job. On August 8, 2009, Rambis was announced as the new head coach for the Minnesota Timberwolves, agreeing to a contract believed to be for 4 years and worth $8 million. Rambis succeeded Kevin McHale, infamous for taking him down in Game 4 of the 1984 NBA Finals. On July 12, 2011, Rambis was fired as coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves after compiling a 32–132 record in two seasons with the team.[11] On July 29, 2013, the Lakers announced they had re-hired Rambis as an assistant coach.[12] On July 7, 2014, the Knicks announced they had hired Rambis to be the assistant head coach of the team under head coach Derek Fisher.[13] On February 8, 2016, Rambis was named the interim head coach after Fisher was fired.[14] After going 9-19 under Rambis, and finishing the season 32–50 overall, the Knicks decided to hire Jeff Hornacek as the team's new head coach, while Rambis was retained as associate head coach. On April 12, 2018, Rambis was fired along with Hornacek, who went 60–104 over two seasons with the Knicks.[15] In September 2018, Rambis rejoined the Lakers as a senior basketball adviser.[16][17] Rambis also had a recurring role as Coach Cleary in the family drama 7th Heaven. He also guest-starred in season one of Sweet Valley High in episode thirteen ""Club X"" as a friend of Elizabeth and in an episode of The Commish as a basketball player. Rambis made a cameo guest appearance in season 8 of the hit show Married... with Children,[citation needed] and also appeared in the 'Going Places' episode (as himself) of It's Garry Shandling's Show. Rambis also made a cameo appearance in an episode of Malcolm & Eddie. Rambis is also mentioned in the songs ""Blao!"" by rapper Hot Karl, ""Mayor"" by Pac Div, and ""Kurt Rambis"" by Sean Price. In ""Blao!"", the line states ""I'm wearing the goggles that Kurt Rambis used to sport."" The song was featured on NBA Live 2003. In ""Mayor"", the line states ""your boy hustle hard like Rambis for the Lakers."" ""Kurt Rambis"" by Sean Price, is titled after him and briefly mentions him in the tracks.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/242.png
243,Jack Ramsay,"February 21, 1925","April 28, 2014","Upper Darby in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania",Saint Joseph's,1969,1989,21,true,,"""[2, 1, 2, 1]""",/coaches/ramsaja99c.html,"John Travilla Ramsay (February 21, 1925 – April 28, 2014) was an American basketball coach, commonly known as ""Dr. Jack"" (as he held an earned doctorate). He was best known for leading the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1977 NBA Title, and for his broadcasting work with the Indiana Pacers, the Miami Heat, and for ESPN TV and ESPN Radio. Ramsay was among the most respected coaches in NBA history and a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He was the winner of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award for the 2009–10 NBA season.[1] Growing up in Milford, Connecticut, Jack Ramsay was encouraged to participate in sports in grade school by his parents, Anne and John. With his family moving to a Philadelphia suburb, Ramsay graduated from Upper Darby High School in 1942. Years after playing basketball, baseball and soccer in high school, he was inducted into the school's Wall of Fame in 1979.[2] Strongly encouraged by his mother to attend college, Ramsay entered Saint Joseph's College. Ramsay's college career was interrupted by three years of service in the US Navy during World War II. Ramsay played both basketball and baseball at St. Joseph's. In his senior year, Ramsay was coached in baseball by Pep Young, a teammate of professional baseball star Ty Cobb. In 1949, Ramsay became the first member of his family to receive a college bachelor's degree. In 1962, Ramsay obtained his master's degree and in 1963 his doctorate degree in education, both from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.[citation needed] After graduation, Ramsay played six seasons of professional basketball in the Eastern Pennsylvania Basketball League. As a sophomore playing guard, he was the second-leading scorer for the Harrisburg Senators in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Ramsay averaged 14 points in his career playing for the Senators and the Sunbury, Pennsylvania professional team. To supplement his playing income, he coached basketball at St. James High School in Chester, Pennsylvania and later at Mount Pleasant High School, 1953-4, in Wilmington, Delaware.[3] After coaching in the high school and minor-league ranks during the early postwar years, Ramsay became head coach at St Joseph's in 1955. Ramsay got the job after accidentally meeting the college's moderator of athletics at a Philadelphia Phillies baseball game. Ramsay was hired as coach for the 1955-56 basketball season for $3,500. In Ramsay's first season at St Joseph, the Hawks went 23-6 to win their first Big 5 crown. This first season also marked the school's first-ever postseason playoff berth, in which St Joseph placed third in the NIT after losing to the University of Dayton. Ramsay would remain at St. Joseph's through 1966, leading the Hawks to six more Big 5 crowns, five straight seasons of first-place finishes in the Middle Atlantic Conference, ten postseason appearances, and a Final Four stint in 1961. At age 41, after leading his team to a 24-5 record in 1965-66, Ramsay was diagnosed with an edema on the retina of his right eye. Ramsay left his coaching job with the Hawks on the doctors' recommendation that he reduce stress. Ramsay finished with a record of 234-72 in 11 years.[3] He would remain the winningest coach in St. Joseph's history until Phil Martelli passed him in 2005. After leaving St Joseph's, Ramsay was hired as general manager by the Philadelphia 76ers. Team owner Irv Kosloff gave Ramsay a three-year $25,000 deal. In Ramsay's first season, the 76ers won the NBA title after finishing 68–13, then the best record in NBA history. The team averaged 125 points with Wilt Chamberlain contributing an average of 24 points, 24 rebounds and eight assists per game. However, Ramsay was forced to trade Chamberlain and Chet Walker, receiving little value in return. In 1968, Ramsay became the 76ers head coach. In Ramsay's first game coaching an NBA team, the 76ers zone press won 114–96 against the Los Angeles Lakers at the Spectrum, even though Lakers players Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Chamberlain combined for 71 points. The 76ers finished that first season with Coach Ramsay 55–27. The 76ers led the NBA in scoring (119 points per game) as a result of Ramsay's style of aggressive pressing defense. In his four seasons as 76ers coach, Ramsay led the team to three playoff appearances. While the 76ers continued to be contenders, the team was much weaker than in previous seasons. The team's collapse came in 1971–72, when the 76ers posted to 30–52 record and missed the playoffs for the first time in team history. After the 1971–72 season, Ramsay became the head coach of the Buffalo Braves. After compiling a losing 21–61 record in that first season in Buffalo, Ramsay had the team double their win total the next season by finishing first among the league's 17 teams in offense (111.6) even though they were last in defense (111.8). That second season in Buffalo had Ramsay leading the Braves to the playoffs, where they pushed the eventual champion Celtics to six games in the conference semifinals.[3] His Buffalo tenure was almost a mirror image of his time with the Sixers—four seasons, three playoff berths; however, he did not leave Buffalo in the sort of wreckage that had occurred in Philadelphia. Instead, owner Paul Snyder was in the process of selling the team to out-of-town interests (the economy of Western New York was unable to support both the Braves and hockey's Sabres as evidenced by the Braves' attendance figures at the time but Snyder lost interest) and Ramsay requested not to be a part of the upheaval.[4] In his four seasons with the Braves, Ramsay compiled a record of 158–170. In 1976, Ramsay became the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers. When Ramsay arrived, the Blazers had not made the playoffs or compiled a winning season record in their six-year history. However, a young Blazers team, led by Bill Walton, was starting to gel. Ramsay also benefited from the 1976 ABA dispersal draft, in which the Blazers obtained power forward Maurice Lucas. In his first season in Portland (1977), Ramsay led the Blazers to their first NBA title. In his second season, the Blazers were 50–10 after 60 games and favored to repeat as NBA champions. However, Walton broke his foot, ending the Blazers' winning prospects. Ramsay continued to coach the Blazers until 1986 with general success. However, he never equaled the achievements of his first seasons. During Ramsay's last nine seasons in Portland, the Blazers only won two playoff series. He also coached the Western Conference side in the 1978 All-Star Game. Ramsay took over as coach of the Indiana Pacers for the 1986–87 season. Ramsay coached the Pacers to their second winning record as an NBA team. However, Ramsay was unable to duplicate that success in later seasons. Ramsay resigned as Pacers coach during the 1988–89 season after a 0–7 start. When Ramsay left the Pacers, he was second on the all-time wins list for NBA coaches with 864 wins, trailing only Red Auerbach. When he retired, Ramsay had the most combined college and professional wins of any coach.[5] In 1992, Ramsay was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.[3] The Trail Blazers retired Number 77 in Ramsay's honor on Jan. 14, 1993, symbolically recognizing the 1977 Championship.[6] In 1996, he was voted one of the 10 greatest coaches in NBA history. After his coaching career ended, Ramsay spent nine years as a television color commentator for the Philadelphia 76ers and the Miami Heat. The games were broadcast from South Florida's Sunshine Network (now Sun Sports), Fox Sports Florida, and sometimes local Miami station WBFS (then a UPN affiliate). Ramsay worked alongside announcer Eric Reid. During Ramsay's tenure as Heat commentator, he developed some memorable nicknames and phrases for the Heat players. Whenever point guard Tim Hardaway made a three-point shot, Ramsay shouted, ""this away, that away, Hardaway!"" When Alonzo Mourning dunked the ball, Ramsay exclaimed ""Zo with the stuffa!"". Whenever a Heat player made a nice shot, Ramsay screamed ""bottom of the net!"" Between 1996 and 2012, Ramsay called 15 NBA Finals for ESPN Radio, serving as the network's top analyst.[7] He joined ESPN from the Heat full-time in 2000.[8] In addition to his TV and radio work, Ramsay authored several books, including The Coach's Art (.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:""\""""""\""""""'""""'""}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png"")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png"")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png"")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png"")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}ISBN 0-917304-36-5) and Dr. Jack's Leadership Lessons Learned From a Lifetime in Basketball (ISBN 0-471-46929-7). Ramsay's son-in-law Jim O'Brien has been the head coach of the Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers, Indiana Pacers and The University of Dayton, and grandson Jack O'Brien was the editor-in-chief of humor website Cracked.com. Grandson Geoff Dailey played baseball at Wesleyan University.[citation needed] His two eldest children, Susan and John, have doctoral degrees and taught at the college level. Another son, John, was an assistant dean at Carleton College. Ramsay counted on the late David Halberstam and Gay Talese as his friends.[9] Ramsay was a devout Roman Catholic.[10] An avid amateur tennis player, Ramsay and Van Miller (the Braves' radio announcer and a close friend of Ramsay's) often played as a doubles team.[11] Ramsay had a pair of concussions in his playing career; one happened while playing a college game in 1948, the second in 1954 during an Eastern League game. In 1999, a routine medical exam revealed an early diagnosis of prostate cancer. The ensuing therapy led to a successful treatment that Ramsay didn't miss a single game that season as commentator. In October 2004, Ramsay was diagnosed with melanoma. He had another bout with the disease in his later years. On May 10, 2013, Ramsay announced that he was again starting cancer treatment, ending his broadcasting career.[12] Ramsay died of cancer in his sleep the night of April 28, 2014.[13][14] He was 89. Ramsay's longtime employer ESPN announced his death on Twitter.[15]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/243.png
244,Willis Reed,"June 25, 1942",,"West Side in Lillie, Louisiana",Grambling State University,1978,1989,4,true,,"""[2, 3]""",/coaches/reedwi01c.html,"Willis Reed Jr. (born June 25, 1942) is an American retired basketball player, coach and general manager. He spent his entire professional playing career (1964–1974) with the New York Knicks. In 1982, Reed was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[1] In 1996, he was voted one of the ""50 Greatest Players in NBA History"".[2] After retiring as a player, Reed served as assistant and head coach with several teams for nearly a decade, then was promoted to general manager and vice president of basketball operations (1989 to 1996) for the New Jersey Nets. As senior vice president of basketball operations, he led them to the NBA Finals in 2002 and 2003.[3] Reed was born on June 25, 1942 in Dubach, Louisiana within Lincoln Parish. He grew up on a farm in nearby Bernice, Louisiana. His parents worked to ensure Reed got an education in the segregated South. Reed showed athletic ability at an early age and played basketball at West Side High School in Lillie, Louisiana.[1] Reed attended Grambling State University, a historically black college. Playing for the Grambling State Tigers men's basketball team, Reed amassed 2,280 career points, averaging 26.6 points per game and 21.3 rebounds per game during his senior year. He led the Tigers to one NAIA title and three Southwestern Athletic Conference championships.[1] Reed also became a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.[4] The New York Knicks selected Reed in the second round, with the eighth overall selection, in the 1964 NBA draft. Reed quickly made a name as a fierce, dominating and physical force on both ends of the floor. In March 1965, he scored 46 points against the Los Angeles Lakers, the second-highest single game total ever by the Knicks' rookie. For the 1964–65 season, he ranked seventh in the NBA in scoring (19.5 points per game) and fifth in rebounding (14.7 rebounds per game). He also began his string of All-Star appearances and won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award while also being named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. Reed proved to be a clutch playoff performer throughout his career. He gave an early indication of this in the 1966–67 season when he improved his regular season averages to 20.9 points per game, and scoring 27.5 points per game in the postseason. He played center. Despite his relatively average stature for a basketball player, he made up for his lack of height by playing a physical game, often ending seasons with respectable averages in blocking and rebounding. He stood 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m) when contemporaries such as Wilt Chamberlain stood 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m). The team continued to struggle for a few years while adding good players through trades and the draft. Dick McGuire was replaced as coach with Red Holzman, midway through the 1967–68 season. The Knicks had gone 15–22 under McGuire; Holzman steered them to a 28–17 finish. In 1968, New York's record was 43–39, its first winning record since the 1958–59 season.[citation needed] Reed continued to make annual appearances in the NBA All-Star Game. By this time, he was playing power forward, in order to make room for Walt Bellamy. Reed averaged 11.6 rebounds in 1965–66 and 14.6 in 1966–67, both top 10 marks in the league. By the latter season, he had adjusted to the nuances of his new position, averaging 20.9 points to rank eighth in the NBA.[citation needed] In 1968–69, New York held opponents to a league-low 105.2 points per game. With Reed clogging the middle and Walt Frazier pressuring the ball, the Knicks would be the best defensive club in the league for five of the next six seasons. Reed scored 21.1 points per game in 1968–69 and grabbed a franchise record 1,191 rebounds, an average of 14.5 rebounds per game. In the 1969–70 season, the Knicks won a franchise record 60 games and set a then single season NBA record with an 18-game win streak. In 1970, Reed became the first player in NBA history to be named the NBA All-Star Game MVP, the NBA regular season MVP, and the NBA Finals MVP in the same season. That same year, he was named to the All-NBA First Team and NBA All-Defensive First Team, as well as being named as ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year, and the Sporting News NBA MVP.[citation needed] Reed's most famous performance took place on May 8, 1970, during game seven of the 1970 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers in Madison Square Garden. Due to a severe thigh injury, a torn muscle that had previously kept him out of game six, he was considered unlikely to play in game seven. However, Reed surprised the fans by walking onto the court during warmups, prompting widespread applause. Starting the game, he scored the Knicks' first two field goals on his first two shot attempts, his only points of the game. Following the game in the winner's locker room, a moved Howard Cosell told Reed on national television, ""You exemplify the very best that the human spirit can offer.""[5] The Knicks slipped to a 52–30 record in the 1970–71 season, still good enough for first place in the Atlantic Division; and in mid-season, Reed tied Harry Gallatin's all-time club record by grabbing 33 rebounds against the Cincinnati Royals. Once again, Reed started in the All-Star Game. For the season, he averaged 20.9 points and 13.7 rebounds per game, but the Knicks were eliminated by the Baltimore Bullets in the Eastern Conference Finals. In 1971–72, Reed was bothered by tendinitis in his left knee, limiting his mobility. He missed two weeks early in the season and returned, but shortly thereafter the injured knee prohibited him from playing, and he totaled 11 games for the year. Without Reed, the Knicks still managed to make the NBA Finals, but were defeated in five games by the Los Angeles Lakers. The 1972–73 Knicks finished the season with a 57–25 record and went on to win another NBA title. Reed was less of a contributor than he was two seasons earlier. In 69 regular season games, he averaged only 11.0 points. In the playoffs, the Knicks beat the Bullets and upset the Boston Celtics, and again faced the Lakers in the NBA Finals. After losing the first game, the Knicks captured four straight, claiming their second NBA championship with a 102–93 victory in game five. Reed was named NBA Finals MVP. Reed's career was cut short by injuries, and he retired after the 1973–74 season. For his career, Reed averaged 18.7 points and 12.9 rebounds per game, playing 650 games. He played in seven All-Star Games. Reed spent several years coaching before moving into general management. He coached the Knicks in 1977–1978, and left the team 14 games into the following season (49–47 record). He was the head coach at Creighton University from 1981 to 1985 and volunteer assistant coach for St. John's University. Reed also served as an assistant coach for the NBA's Atlanta Hawks and Sacramento Kings.[6] Reed debuted as head coach of the New Jersey Nets on March 1, 1988, one week after the Nets' star forward and his cousin, Orlando Woolridge, was suspended by the league and was to undergo drug rehabilitation.[7] He compiled a 33–77 record with the Nets. In 1989, he was hired as the Nets' general manager and vice president of basketball operations (1989–1996). During this time, he drafted Derrick Coleman and Kenny Anderson, acquired Dražen Petrović, and made the Nets a playoff contender throughout the early 1990s. Reed hired Chuck Daly to coach the Nets for the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons. In 1996, Reed moved to the position of senior vice president of basketball operations, with the continued goal of building the Nets into a championship contender. The Nets made the NBA Finals in 2002 and 2003. Reed next took the position of vice president of basketball operations with the New Orleans Hornets in 2004. He retired from that position in 2007.[8] Rap songs have mentioned Reed, recognizing his impressive athleticism and skill. Examples include Kurtis Blow's 1984 hit ""Basketball""[10] on his Ego Trip album, and the Beastie Boys' ""Long Burn The Fire"" on their 2011 album Hot Sauce Committee Part Two.[11] Reed's name has become synonymous with playing through injury, as Cris Collinsworth described an injured Aaron Rodgers as having a ""Willis Reed kind of night"" on the NBC Sunday Night Football broadcast on September 9, 2018.[citation needed]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/244.png

247,Pat Riley,"March 20, 1945",,"Linton in Schenectady, New York",Kentucky,1982,2008,24,true,,"""[1, 2, 1]""",/coaches/rileypa01c.html,"Patrick James Riley (born March 20, 1945) is an American professional basketball executive and a former coach and player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has been the team president of the Miami Heat since 1995 and head coach in two separate tenures (1995 through 2003, and 2005 through 2008). Regarded as one of the greatest NBA coaches of all time, Riley has served as the head coach of five championship teams. He won four with the Los Angeles Lakers during their Showtime era in the 1980s, and one with the Heat in 2006. He was named NBA Coach of the Year three times (1989–90, 1992–93 and 1996–97, as head coach of the Lakers, New York Knicks and Heat, respectively). He was head coach of an NBA All-Star Game team nine times: eight times with the Western Conference team (1982, 1983, 1985–1990, all as head coach of the Lakers) and once with the Eastern team (1993, as head coach of the Knicks). He is the first North American sports figure to win a championship as a player, assistant coach, head coach, and as an executive. In 1996, he was named one of the 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history. As a player, he played for the Lakers' championship team in 1972. Riley most recently won the 2012 and 2013 NBA championships with the Heat as their team president. He received the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award from the NBA Coaches Association on June 20, 2012. Riley was born in Rome, New York and raised in Schenectady, New York. His father, Leon Riley, played twenty-two seasons of minor league baseball as an outfielder and first baseman, and appeared in four games for the 1944 Philadelphia Phillies.[1][2] Riley played basketball for Linton High School in Schenectady, New York under head coach Walt Przybylo and his assistants Bill Rapavy and Ed Catino.[3] Linton High School's 74–68 victory over New York City's Power Memorial on December 29, 1961, is remembered mostly for its two stars: Power Memorial's Lew Alcindor (who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar); and his future coach with the Los Angeles Lakers, Pat Riley.[4] In 1991, Riley called it, ""One of the greatest games in the history of Schenectady basketball."" Riley was a versatile athlete in college, participating in both basketball and football. As a junior on the 1965–66 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team he was named First Team All-SEC, All-NCAA Tournament Team, NCAA Regional Player of the Year, SEC Player of the Year and AP Third Team All-American, leading the Wildcats to the 1966 NCAA title game. Coached by Adolph Rupp, UK lost to Texas Western (today's UTEP), a game that was reenacted in the movie Glory Road. In his senior year Riley made First Team All-SEC, one of the only players in storied Kentucky Basketball history to make two or more First Team All-SEC teams.[5] He was selected by the San Diego Rockets in the 1st round of the 1967 NBA draft, and was also drafted as a wide receiver by the Dallas Cowboys in the 11th round of the 1967 NFL Draft. He joined the Rockets and was later selected by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1970 NBA expansion draft,[6] but was immediately traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, which he helped toward the 1972 NBA Championship both by coming off the bench in games and by guarding friend and Laker guard Jerry West in practice. He retired after the 1975–76 NBA season as a member of the Western Conference champion Phoenix Suns. Riley finished his NBA playing career with a 7.4 points per game scoring average and a field-goal percentage of 41.4%.[7] Riley returned to the NBA in 1977 as a broadcaster for the Lakers. During the 1979–80 season, when the team's head coach, Jack McKinney, was injured during a near-fatal bicycle accident, assistant coach Paul Westhead took over the team's head coaching duties. Riley then moved from the broadcast booth to the bench as one of Westhead's assistant coaches. With rookie guard Magic Johnson and longtime star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the Lakers won the 1980 NBA Finals, defeating Philadelphia in six games, giving Westhead and Riley championship rings in their first year coaching the team. However, the team lost in the playoffs the next year to the Moses Malone-led Houston Rockets. Six games into the 1981–82 season, Magic Johnson said he wished to be traded because he was unhappy playing for Westhead. Shortly afterward, Lakers' owner Jerry Buss fired Westhead. At an ensuing press conference, with Jerry West at his side, Buss named West head coach. West, however, balked, and Buss awkwardly tried to name West as ""offensive captain"" and then named West and Riley as co-coaches.[8] West made it clear during the press conference that he would only assist Riley, and that Riley was the head coach.[9] Thereafter, Riley was the interim head coach, until his status became permanent. Riley ushered in the Lakers' ""Showtime"" era, along with superstar players Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar with their running game. Riley became a celebrity in his own right, a fashion icon for his Armani suits and slicked-back hair which complemented the team's Hollywood image.[10] Riley led the Lakers to four consecutive NBA Finals appearances. His first title came in his first season, against the Philadelphia 76ers. Both teams returned to the Finals the next year, and this time Riley's Lakers were swept by the 76ers. The Lakers lost in the Finals again in 1984, to the Boston Celtics in seven games.[11] The Lakers earned Riley his second NBA title in 1985 in a rematch of the previous year, as the Lakers beat the Celtics in six games. The Lakers' four-year Western Conference streak was broken the following year by the Houston Rockets. In 1987, Riley coached a Lakers team that is considered one of the best teams of all-time. With future Hall of Famers Magic Johnson, James Worthy and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, plus Michael Cooper, Byron Scott, A. C. Green, Mychal Thompson, and Kurt Rambis, the Lakers finished 65–17 in the regular season, third-best in team history. They met with similar success in the playoffs, dispatching the Celtics in six games to win Riley his third NBA title. One of Riley's most famous moments came when he guaranteed the crowd a repeat championship during the Lakers' championship parade in downtown Los Angeles (he first made the guarantee during the post-victory locker room celebration).[12] While the 1988 Lakers did not produce as many wins in the regular season as the 1987 Lakers, they still won the NBA title, becoming the first team in 19 years to repeat as champions. The Lakers beat the Detroit Pistons in seven games in the 1988 NBA Finals, making good on Riley's promise. Riley's titles with the Lakers make him one of six men to play for an NBA Championship team and later coach the same NBA team to a championship; the others are George Senesky, Bill Russell, Tom Heinsohn, K. C. Jones and Billy Cunningham. Although Riley would offer no further guarantees, his Lakers embarked upon a quest to obtain a third consecutive championship in 1989. Having successfully claimed a repeat championship the year before, the term used for this new goal was a three-peat championship, and Riley, through his corporate entity, Riles & Co., trademarked the phrase three-peat. However, in a rematch of the previous year's finals series, the Lakers were swept by the Pistons in the 1989 NBA Finals. Riley was named NBA Coach of the Year for the first time in 1989–90, but stepped down as Lakers head coach after they lost to the Phoenix Suns in the playoffs. At the time of his departure, Riley was the foremost coach in the NBA with a level of fame not seen since Red Auerbach.[13] After stepping down, Riley accepted a job as a television commentator for NBC for one year before being named head coach of the New York Knicks, starting with the 1991–92 season. Commentators admired Riley's ability to work with the physical, deliberate Knicks, adapting his ""Showtime"" style with the fast-paced Laker teams in the 1980s. The Chicago Bulls had easily swept the Knicks in 1991 en route to their first championship. However, in 1992, with Riley, the Knicks pushed the defending champion Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The physical defense of the Knicks against the Chicago Bulls' finesse superstars Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen during the 1992 playoffs led to a feud between Riley and Bulls head coach Phil Jackson regarding the officiating and the Knicks' rough style of play. In 1993, Riley led the Knicks to their best regular season record in team history (tied with the 1969–1970 team) and received his second Coach of the Year award. The Knicks again met the Bulls in the Eastern Conference finals but lost in six games after the winning the first two games at home. Jackson's Bulls that season went on to win the finals and accomplish the first ""three-peat,"" despite Riley's trademark in 1989.[14] Riley returned to the NBA Finals, in 1994, en route defeating the three-time defending champion Bulls (without Michael Jordan) in seven games during the Eastern Conference semifinals. However, New York lost in seven games to the Houston Rockets after being up 3–2 in the series. During the 1994 Finals, Riley became the first coach to participate in an NBA Finals Game 7 with two teams, having been with the Lakers in 1984 and 1988. However, he had the unfortunate distinction of becoming the first (and to date, only) coach to lose an NBA Finals Game 7 with two teams, having lost to the Celtics, in 1984. It also denied him the distinction of becoming the first coach to win a Game 7 in the Finals with two teams, having defeated the Pistons in seven games, in 1988. In 1995, Riley resigned from the Knicks via fax to become president and head coach of the Miami Heat, with complete control over basketball operations. The move caused some controversy, as the Heat were accused by the Knicks of tampering by pursuing Riley while he still had a year remaining on his contract with the Knicks.[15] The matter was settled after the Heat sent their 1996 first-round pick (which the Knicks used to draft Walter McCarty) and $1 million in cash to the Knicks on September 1, 1995. Riley's coaching of the Heat to playoff contention later made them bitter rivals with his former team. In 1995–96, Riley led the Heat to a 10-game turnaround to finish 42–40. Miami was swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Phil Jackson-coached Chicago Bulls, who had completed the regular season with a record 72 wins, a record since broken by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors. This season was most notable for the ongoing housecleaning that took place, with the arrival of building blocks Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway. The off-season also brought them Nets forward P.J. Brown and Suns swingman Dan Majerle. In 1997, Riley's Heat defeated his old team, the Knicks, in a physical seven game series. Advancing to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in franchise history, they again proved no match for Jordan and the Bulls. Riley was selected as Coach of the Year for the third time however, after leading Miami to a 61–21 regular season record for first place in the Atlantic division. The Heat compiled consecutive seasons over .600. However, the 1998, 1999, and 2000 playoffs were disappointments, as they lost to the arch-rival Knicks; the first two in the opening round and the latter in the second round. In 1999, the Knicks themselves reached the Finals. Riley then traded Brown and Jamal Mashburn in exchange for Eddie Jones in one trade and acquired Brian Grant in another, although the team suffered a major setback after Alonzo Mourning was lost for the season due to a kidney ailment. After finishing 50–32 in the 2000–01 season, the Heat were swept by the Charlotte Hornets in the first round of the NBA playoffs. The Heat then lost two of their best players when guard Tim Hardaway was traded to the Dallas Mavericks and Anthony Mason signed with the Milwaukee Bucks. In part because of these departures, the Heat finished 36–46 in 2002–the first time that a Riley-coached team had not had a winning season or made the playoffs. Riley was so disgusted with the Heat's performance that he declared he was about to ""fire himself"". After finishing the 2002–03 season 25–57, Riley stepped down as head coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant Stan Van Gundy. Van Gundy and rookie Dwyane Wade, whom Riley drafted 5th overall, led the Heat back into the playoffs with a 42–40 record after starting 0–7. Riley concentrated on improving the team even further before the 2004–2005 season. One of his biggest moves was to trade Caron Butler, Brian Grant, Lamar Odom and a first-round draft pick to the Lakers for Shaquille O'Neal. O'Neal had just come off a successful stint with the Phil Jackson-coached Lakers, winning three straight championships from 2000–02 and a 2004 Finals loss. By this time, Riley and Jackson's feud had cooled.[16] Wade and O'Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference finals during the 2005 playoffs, although they lost to the defending champions Detroit Pistons after being up 3–2 in the series. Wade had missed game 6 entirely due to injury.[17] During the 2005 off-season, it was widely speculated that Riley was attempting to run Van Gundy out of his coaching job and take over the job himself, now that the team was in a position to contend for the championship.[18] Indeed, Van Gundy resigned from his position as head coach on December 12, 2005, just 21 games into the season, citing a need to spend more time with his family, and Riley resumed coaching the team.[19] Riley's Heat team defeated the Detroit Pistons in the 2006 Eastern Conference Finals on June 2, 2006, making it the first time the Miami Heat reached the finals. Riley's Heat squared off against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Finals. Despite losing the first two games to Dallas, the Heat rallied to win the next four games and their first NBA Championship. After Game Six, Riley commented that he had packed one suit, one shirt and one tie for the trip to Dallas. It was Riley's fifth championship as a head coach, and his first with a team other than the Lakers. Riley became one of only two NBA coaches to take three teams to the NBA Finals, the other being Alex Hannum. He joined Hannum and Phil Jackson as the only head coaches to lead two teams to NBA titles. He also became the only coach to twice replace a coach in mid-season and take that team to an NBA title.[20] Citing hip and knee problems, Riley took a leave of absence from coaching from January 3, 2007, through February 19, 2007. Assistant coach Ron Rothstein assumed interim duties. The Heat finished the season 44–38 and were swept out of the first round of the playoffs by the Chicago Bulls; the first defending champions to be swept in the first round since 1957.[21] The following season, the Heat finished 15–67. The team had lost several of its players to extended injuries, and a disgruntled Shaquille O'Neal was traded mid-season. Two years after winning the championship, they finished with one of the worst records of all time.[22] On April 28, 2008, Riley announced that he would step down as coach of the Heat. Former Heat assistant Erik Spoelstra was announced as his replacement. Riley remains team president.[23] Although the Heat have nominally had a general manager for most of Riley's tenure as team president, Riley has had the final say in basketball matters since his arrival in Miami. As president, Riley acquired LeBron James and Chris Bosh to form the Heat's ""Big Three"" with Dwyane Wade. In 2012, the Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder to give Riley his first championship purely as an executive. The Heat repeated the feat in 2013, defeating the San Antonio Spurs. Outside basketball, Riley has developed into a pop culture figure. This is born out of Riley's signature look, a slicked-back hairstyle, which is often described as gangster-or mafioso-like, and his immaculate tan. He came to the public eye leading the Showtime Lakers of the 1980s, furthering his image by ""guaranteeing"" a championship. In 1988, Riley published a book entitled Showtime: Inside the Lakers' Breakthrough Season, a New York Times best seller which recapped the Lakers' successful run to the 1987 NBA Championship. One of the phrases Riley coined in the book was the ""Disease of More"", stating that ""success is often the first step toward disaster"" and that defending champions often fail the following season because every player who returns wants more playing time, more shots per game, and more money. The phrase stemmed from the Lakers' disappointing 1980–81 campaign coming off a championship the previous season. Riley's name and likeness were used for a 1990 Sega Genesis video game, Pat Riley Basketball. In 1993, while coaching the New York Knicks, Riley published a second New York Times bestseller entitled The Winner Within: A Life Plan for Team Players. Aimed at a business leadership as well as basketball enthusiasts, it distilled a lesson in teamwork and leadership from each of Riley's seasons as a coach to that date. Byron Laursen, saluted by Riley as ""...a true Showtime Warrior"", co-authored both of Riley's books. Riley is known for his friendship with Giorgio Armani, preferring to wear Armani suits during basketball games, and modeling once at an Armani show. Riley is also a motivational speaker during the off-season. Riley earns in excess of $50,000 for each speaking engagement.[citation needed] Riley and his wife Chris have two children, James and Elisabeth. Riley is a practicing Roman Catholic.[24] On February 27, 2007, the Miami Heat were honored for their 2005–2006 NBA Championship at the White House. During the ceremony, Riley presented George W. Bush with a jersey before announcing, ""I voted for the man. If you don't vote, you don't count."" After the ceremony, Riley was questioned by reporters about the political nature of his comments. He responded by saying, ""I'm pro-American, pro-democracy, I'm pro-government. I follow my boss. He's my boss.""[25] Riley and his wife are Bruce Springsteen fans. At his 2008 induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame, he ended his speech with a quote from the Springsteen song ""Back in Your Arms Again"".",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/247.png

As an NBA point guard, Rivers was known for his defense, a trait that has carried over into his coaching. Rivers was a McDonald's All-American for Proviso East High School in the Chicago metropolitan area.[1] Rivers represented the United States with the national team in the 1982 FIBA World Championship, in which he led the team to the silver medal, despite missing the last shot in the final, which could have given the title to his team. After his third season at Marquette University, Rivers was drafted in the second round (31st overall[2]) of the 1983 NBA draft by the Atlanta Hawks. He graduated from Marquette while completing course work as an NBA player. He spent the next seven seasons as a starter in Atlanta, assisting star Dominique Wilkins as the team found great regular-season success. He averaged a double-double for the 1986–87 season with 12.8 points and 10.0 assists per game. Rivers later spent one year as a starter for the Los Angeles Clippers and two more for the New York Knicks, before finishing his career as a player for the San Antonio Spurs from 1994 to 1996. Rivers began his coaching career with the Orlando Magic in 1999, where he coached for more than four NBA seasons. Rivers won the Coach of the Year award in 2000 after his first year with the Magic. That season, he led the team that was picked to finish last in the league to a near playoff berth. During the Magic's free agency spending spree in the summer of 2000, Doc Rivers had the opportunity to assemble the first ""Big Three"" team in the NBA, as the Magic were courting free agent Tim Duncan, who came close to signing with the Magic and teaming up with Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady. However, Tim Duncan re-signed with the San Antonio Spurs due to Rivers' strict policy of family members not being allowed to travel in the team's plane.[3] He made the post-season in his next three years as coach, but was fired in 2003 after a 1–10 start to the season. After spending a year working as a commentator for the NBA on ABC (calling the 2004 Finals with Al Michaels), he was hired by the Boston Celtics as their head coach in 2004. During his first years with the Celtics, he was criticized by many in the media for his coaching style, most vociferously by Bill Simmons, who in 2006 publicly called for Rivers to be fired in his columns. As a result of the Celtics' 109–93 victory over the New York Knicks on January 21, 2008, Rivers, as the coach of the team with the best winning percentage in the Eastern Conference, earned the honor to coach the East for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans.[4] On June 17, 2008, Rivers won his first NBA Championship as a head coach after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.[5] The Celtics needed an NBA record 26 post-season games to win it. Rivers played for the team that held the previous record for most games played in a single post-season: the 1994 New York Knicks played 25 post-season games. Rivers led the Celtics to the 2010 NBA Finals where they once again faced the Los Angeles Lakers and lost the series in seven games. After deliberating between staying on the job and leaving the job and returning to spend more time with his family in Orlando, Rivers finally decided that he would honor the last year of his contract and return for the 2010–11 season.[6] On May 13, 2011, after months of rumors that he would retire, ESPN reported that the Celtics and Rivers agreed upon a 5-year contract extension worth $35 million.[7][8] On February 6, 2013, Rivers notched his 400th win with the Celtics in a 99–95 victory over the Toronto Raptors.[9] On June 25, 2013, the Los Angeles Clippers acquired Rivers from the Celtics for an unprotected 2015 NBA first round draft pick. He also became the senior vice president of basketball operations on the team.[10] In his first season as their head coach, Rivers led the Clippers to a franchise-record 57 wins, garnering the 3rd seed in the Western conference. The 2014 NBA playoffs first round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors was marred when TMZ released an audiotape containing racially insensitive remarks made by the then-Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Though there was a possibility of the Clippers boycotting the series, they would play on, holding a silent protest by leaving their shooting jerseys at center court and obscuring the Clippers logo on their warm-up shirts. Rivers himself stated that he would not return to the Clippers if Sterling remained as owner the following season. NBA commissioner Adam Silver responded to the controversy by banning Sterling for life and compelling him to sell the team. After the team was sold to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2 billion on August 12, 2014, Rivers remained with the Clippers.[11] On June 16, 2014, the Clippers promoted Rivers to president of basketball operations in conjunction with his continuing head coaching duties. Although Dave Wohl was hired as general manager, Rivers had the final say in basketball matters.[12] On August 27, 2014, he signed a new five-year contract with the Clippers.[13] On January 16, 2015, Rivers became the first NBA coach to coach his own son, Austin Rivers until June 26, 2018, when he was traded to the Washington Wizards for Marcin Gortat. On August 4, 2017, Rivers gave up his post as president of basketball operations. However, he continued to split responsibility for basketball matters with executive vice president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank.[14] On May 23, 2018, Rivers and the Clippers agreed to a contract extension.[15] On May 31, 2019, Rivers made comments on Kawhi Leonard during an appearance on ESPN, stating that ""He is the most like Jordan that we've seen"".[16] The Clippers were fined $50,000 due to Rivers' comments in violation of the league's anti-tampering rule.[17] On November 8, 2019, Rivers earned his 900th win as a head coach after the Clippers won against the visiting Portland Trail Blazers.[18] Rivers is the nephew of former NBA player Jim Brewer. He lives in Orlando, Florida,[needs update?] with his wife Kristen; they have four children.[2] His oldest son Jeremiah played basketball at Georgetown University and Indiana University,[19] and has played in the NBA D-League for the Maine Red Claws. His daughter Callie played volleyball for the University of Florida [20] and is married to NBA player Seth Curry,[21][22] while his younger son Austin currently plays for the Houston Rockets. His youngest son, Spencer, is a guard who played for Winter Park High School and for UC Irvine. Rivers is a cousin of former NBA guard Byron Irvin and former MLB outfielder Ken Singleton.[23] Rivers was given his nickname of ""Doc"" by then-Marquette assistant coach Rick Majerus. Rivers attended a summer basketball camp wearing a ""Dr. J"" T-shirt. Majerus immediately called him ""Doc"" and the players at camp followed suit. The name has stuck ever since.[24] Rivers has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder according to a personality test he took when he was coaching the Celtics.[25] Rivers is also currently a member of the National Advisory Board for Positive Coaching Alliance, a national non-profit organization that helps student-athletes and their coaches.[26] Rivers has appeared in several videos for this organization, all of which can be found on the group's YouTube channel.[27]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/248.png
249,Scotty Robertson,"February 1, 1930","August 18, 2011",,,1975,1983,5,true,,"""[2, 5, 9]""",/coaches/robersc99c.html,"Robert Scott ""Scotty"" Robertson III (February 1, 1930 – August 18, 2011) was an American basketball coach. He was the first coach for the New Orleans Jazz (now the Utah Jazz), and he later coached the Chicago Bulls and the Detroit Pistons. He also has a stint as assistant coach for the Indiana Pacers, San Antonio Spurs, Phoenix Suns, and the Miami Heat.[1] Robertson was born in Fort Smith in western Arkansas. As a sixth grader, he moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, where he played basketball and baseball for C. E. Byrd High School, from which he graduated in 1947. He attended the University of Texas at Austin, Texas, but graduated in 1951 from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. He obtained a master's degree from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.[1] After his graduation from Louisiana Tech, he played baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization before returning to basketball as a coach.[2] In the 1952–53 academic year, Robertson coached the Vivian Warriors at the former Vivian High School, now North Caddo High School, he had a season record of 9–20. One of his players was Jasper ""Jake"" Smith III, son of State Representative Jasper K. Smith of Caddo Parish, who mentions Robertson in Smith's autobiographical Dinner with Mobutu: A Chronicle of My Life and Times.[3] Robertson thereafter coached at Byrd High School for eight years, having accomplished a 163–91 record. He then coached at Louisiana Tech from 1964 to 1974. There he amassed a 165–86 record and during the early 1970s led the Bulldogs to a No. 1 ranking in the national college division. The Bulldogs procured three championships in the former Gulf States Conference under Robertson's tutelage and also entered two National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments.[1] At the time of his death of lung cancer at the age of eighty-one, Robertson was residing in Ruston, the location of Louisiana Tech, with his wife the former Betty Lou Lancaster, a member of a prominent family originally from Tensas Parish in eastern Louisiana.[4] He was survived by his daughters, Libby Robertson Power of Frisco, Texas, Claudia Robertson Fowler (husband Royal) of Franklin, Tennessee, and Vicki Robertson Page of Ruston. He had ten grandchildren.[1] Services were held on August 21, 2011, at the Trinity United Methodist Church in Ruston. Interment followed at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Ruston.[1] His obituary describes him, accordingly: ""Despite compiling significant accolades in his professional career, no list does justice in describing a man that touched so many, angered so few and was respected and revered by all. Knowing the man was the only true description of his greatness. For those who knew him, he will never be forgotten. His love will carry on forever.""[1] Robertson was nominated to eight athletic halls of fame and was a Louisiana Tech ""Alumnus of the Year"" for the university school of education. He was a member of the Louisiana Tech Letterman Club and the Byrd High School Super Stars. Robertson was also a collector of classic cars.[1] In 2012, the Robert ""Scotty"" Robertson Memorial Gymnasium, an alternate practice facility for the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs and Lady Techsters basketball teams, was renovated, including the completion of a new floor, and named in Robertson's honor. Among those on the fundraising committee for the project was former Caddo Parish Sheriff Don Hathaway, who graduated from Byrd High School a year before Robertson, and businessman John Caruthers.[5] Robertson coached at C. E. Byrd High School for eight years, having accomplished a 163–91 record.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/249.png

Originally planning to go into dentistry, Rodgers, who was a pre-dental major, decided to go into coaching. After graduation, he was hired as an assistant by Bill Fitch, then the head coach for the University of North Dakota basketball team, whose team featured All-America center Phil Jackson.

A graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, Rolfe also was an Ivy Leaguer: a graduate, then long-time athletic director of Dartmouth College, and (from 1943–46) baseball and basketball coach at Yale University. Rolfe was a native of Penacook, New Hampshire. He batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and was listed as 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and 170 pounds (77 kg). While a student at Dartmouth, Rolfe spent the summer of 1930 playing for the Orleans town team in the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he was skippered by longtime major league player and manager Patsy Donovan.[1][2] During his major league playing career, Rolfe was the starting third baseman on the New York Yankees of the late 1930s. The ""Bronx Bombers"" of Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Bill Dickey, Lefty Gomez and Red Ruffing won American League pennants from 1936–39 and took all four World Series in which they appeared, winning 16 games and losing only three in Fall Classic play over that span. Rolfe played 10 major league seasons, all with New York, batting .289 with 69 home runs and 497 RBI in 1,175 games. His finest season came in 1939, when he led the American League with 213 hits, 139 runs scored, and 46 doubles while hitting .329 with 14 home runs and 80 runs batted in. He retired following the 1942 season. After his four-year coaching stint at Yale, Rolfe coached the Toronto Huskies of the BAA in 1946–1947 and returned to the Yankees as a coach. After the 1947 season, Rolfe joined the Detroit Tigers as director of their farm system. But he returned to the field after only one season, when he succeeded Steve O'Neill as Tiger manager after the 1948 campaign. In 1949, Rolfe's first season as manager, the Tigers improved by nine games and returned to the first division. Then, in 1950, they nearly upset the Yankees, winning 95 games and finishing second, three games behind. A fluke botched double play was the team's undoing. Late in September at Cleveland, the Indians had the bases loaded in the tenth inning with one out and the score tied. Visibility was poor because smoke from Canadian forest fires was blowing across Lake Erie. On an apparent 3-2-3 double-play grounder to first base, Detroit catcher Aaron Robinson thought he simply needed to touch home plate for a force play to retire the Indians baserunner charging in from third. But in the smoky conditions Robinson had not seen that a putout had already been made at first base, necessitating that the catcher tag the runner, not the plate, to record an out. Robinson mistakenly tagged the plate, the run counted and Cleveland won the game. It was the turning point in the pennant race, for the postwar Tigers, and for Rolfe's managerial career. Beset by an aging starting rotation, the Tigers faltered in 1951, slipping to 73 wins and finishing fifth, 25 games behind New York. Then Detroit completely unraveled in 1952, winning only 23 of 72 games under Rolfe. On July 5, he was fired and replaced by one of his pitchers, Fred Hutchinson. The 1952 club won only 50 games, losing 104 – the first time ever that the Tigers lost 100 or more games. Rolfe then returned to Dartmouth as the athletic director of his alma mater from 1954 to 1967. The college's baseball diamond is named in his honor. Rolfe died in Gilford, New Hampshire, in 1969 at age 60 of chronic kidney disease.[3] He was buried in his birthplace of Penacook.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/252.png

His record was 4–47. Rubin had been a highly successful college coach at Long Island University with a winning percentage just short of .650 in 11 years. Before then, he had coached at Christopher Columbus High School in New York City, where he coached the team to six borough championships in the Public Schools Athletic League in nine seasons.[2] He was known as a defensive genius, and had even written a book on how to play defense.[3] Rubin was hired as head coach of the Sixers after Al McGuire and Adolph Rupp both turned it down. The Sixers were so desperate to find a coach that they actually took out an ad in a local paper, which was seen by one of Rubin's friends.[4] However, he walked into a difficult situation in Philadelphia. Only six years removed from winning the NBA title with the best record in league history, the roster had been decimated when several trades by general manager Jack Ramsay backfired, most notably that of Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain. For all intents and purposes, the Sixers' season ended when Billy Cunningham bolted to the American Basketball Association on the day Rubin was hired, leaving Rubin with a roster consisting of Hal Greer and little else.

A five-time NBA Most Valuable Player and a twelve-time All-Star, he was the centerpiece of the Celtics dynasty that won eleven NBA championships during his thirteen-year career. Russell and Henri Richard of the National Hockey League are tied for the record of the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league. Russell led the University of San Francisco to two consecutive NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956, and he captained the gold-medal winning U.S. national basketball team at the 1956 Summer Olympics.[1] Bill Russell is regarded by many as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He is 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) tall, with a 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) wingspan.[2][3] His shot-blocking and man-to-man defense were major reasons for the Celtics' domination of the NBA during his career. Russell was equally notable for his rebounding abilities. He led the NBA in rebounds four times, had a dozen consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds,[4] and remains second all-time in both total rebounds and rebounds per game. He is one of just two NBA players (the other being prominent rival Wilt Chamberlain) to have grabbed more than 50 rebounds in a game. Russell was never the focal point of the Celtics' offense, but he did score 14,522 career points and provided effective passing. Russell played in the wake of black pioneers Earl Lloyd, Chuck Cooper, and Sweetwater Clifton, and he was the first black player to achieve superstar status in the NBA. He also served a three-season (1966–69) stint as player-coach for the Celtics, becoming the first black coach in North American professional sports and the first to win a championship. In 2011, Barack Obama awarded Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his accomplishments on the court and in the Civil Rights Movement.[1] Russell is one of seven players in history to win an NCAA Championship, an NBA Championship, and an Olympic gold medal.[5] He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was selected into the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971 and the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1980, and named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, one of only four players to receive all three honors. In 2007, he was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame. In Russell's honor the NBA renamed the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player trophy in 2009: it is now the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award. Bill Russell was born in 1934 to Charles Russell and Katie Russell in Monroe, Louisiana. Like almost all Southern towns and cities of that time, Monroe was very segregated, and the Russells often struggled with racism in their daily lives.[6] Russell's father was once refused service at a gas station until the staff had taken care of all the white customers first. When he attempted to leave and find a different station, the attendant stuck a shotgun in his face and threatened to kill him if he didn't stay and wait his turn.[6] In another incident, Russell's mother was walking outside in a fancy dress when a white policeman accosted her. He told her to go home and remove the dress, which he described as ""white woman's clothing"".[6] During World War II, large numbers of blacks were moving to the West to look for work there. When Russell was eight years old, his father moved the family out of Louisiana and settled in Oakland, California.[6] While there, they fell into poverty, and Russell spent his childhood living in a series of public housing projects.[6] Charles Russell was described as a ""stern, hard man"" who initially worked in a paper factory as a janitor, which was a typical ""Negro Job""—low paid and not intellectually challenging, as sports journalist John Taylor commented.[7] When World War II broke out, the elder Russell became a truck driver.[7] Russell was closer to his mother Katie than to his father,[7] and he received a major emotional blow when she suddenly died when he was 12 years old. His father gave up his trucking job and became a steelworker to be closer to his semi-orphaned children.[7] Russell has stated that his father became his childhood hero, later followed up by Minneapolis Lakers superstar George Mikan, whom he met when he was in high school.[8] Mikan, in turn, would say of Russell the college basketball player, ""Let's face it, he's the best ever. He's so good, he scares you.""[9] In his early years, Russell struggled to develop his skills as a basketball player. Although Russell was a good runner and jumper and had large hands,[7] he simply did not understand the game and was cut from the team in junior high school. As a freshman at McClymonds High School[10] in Oakland, Russell was almost cut again.[11] However, coach George Powles saw Russell's raw athletic potential and encouraged him to work on his fundamentals.[7] Since Russell's previous experiences with white authority figures were often negative, he was delighted to receive warm words from his white coach. He worked hard and used the benefits of a growth spurt to become a decent basketball player, but it was not until his junior and senior years that he began to excel, winning back to back high school state championships.[11] Russell soon became noted for his unusual style of defense. He later recalled, ""To play good defense ... it was told back then that you had to stay flatfooted at all times to react quickly. When I started to jump to make defensive plays and to block shots, I was initially corrected, but I stuck with it, and it paid off.""[12] Russell, in an autobiographical account, notes while on a California High School All-Stars tour, he became obsessed with studying and memorizing other players' moves (e.g., footwork such as which foot they moved first on which play) as preparation for defending against them, which included practicing in front of a mirror at night. Russell further described himself as an avid reader of Dell Magazines' 1950s sports publications, which he used to scout opponents' moves for the purpose of defending against them.[13] Future Baseball Hall-of-Famer Frank Robinson was one of Russell's high school basketball teammates.[14] Due to his race, Russell was ignored by college recruiters and did not receive a single letter of intent until recruiter Hal DeJulio from the University of San Francisco (USF) watched him play in a high school game. DeJulio was not impressed by Russell's meager scoring and ""atrocious fundamentals"",[15] but sensed that the young center had an extraordinary instinct for the game, especially in the clutch.[15] When DeJulio offered Russell a scholarship, he eagerly accepted.[11] Sports journalist John Taylor described it as a watershed event in Russell's life, because Russell realized that basketball was his one chance to escape poverty and racism. As a consequence, Russell swore to make the best of it.[7] At USF, Russell became the new starting center for coach Phil Woolpert. Woolpert emphasized defense and deliberate half-court play, which were concepts that favored Russell's exceptional defensive skills.[16] Woolpert's choices of how to deploy his players were unaffected by issues of skin color. In 1954, he became the first coach of a major college basketball squad to start three black players: Russell, K. C. Jones and Hal Perry.[17] In his USF years, Russell used his relative lack of bulk to develop a unique style of defense: instead of purely guarding the opposing center, he used his quickness and speed to play help defense against opposing forwards and aggressively challenge their shots.[16] Combining the stature and shot-blocking skills of a center with the foot speed of a guard, Russell became the centerpiece of a USF team that soon became a force in college basketball. After USF kept Holy Cross star Tom Heinsohn scoreless in an entire half, Sports Illustrated wrote, ""If [Russell] ever learns to hit the basket, they're going to have to rewrite the rules.""[16][18] The NCAA did in fact rewrite rules in response to Russell's dominant play; the lane was widened for his junior year. After he graduated, the NCAA rules committee instituted a second new rule to counter the play of big men like Russell; basket interference was now prohibited.[19] The NCAA pays close attention to college basketball superstars. Over the years, several rule changes have gone into effect to counter the dominant play of big men. Two good examples are goal-tending in response to George Mikan (1945) and prohibition of the dunk shot by Lew Alcindor (1967), although that rule was eventually repealed.[20] However, the games were often difficult for the USF squad. Russell and his black teammates became targets of racist jeers, particularly on the road.[21] In one notable incident, hotels in Oklahoma City refused to admit Russell and his black teammates while they were in town for the 1954 All-College Tournament. In protest, the whole team decided to camp out in a closed college dorm, which was later called an important bonding experience for the group.[17] Decades later, Russell explained that his experiences hardened him against abuse of all kinds. ""I never permitted myself to be a victim"", he said.[22][23] Racism also shaped his lifelong paradigm as a team player. ""At that time"", he has said, ""it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen ... My junior year in college, I had what I thought was the one of the best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the [Most Valuable Player] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man."" So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.[24] On the hardwood, his experiences were far more pleasant. Russell led USF to NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956, including a string of 55 consecutive victories. He became known for his strong defense and shot-blocking skills, once denying 13 shots in a game. UCLA coach John Wooden called Russell ""the greatest defensive man I've ever seen"".[17] During his college career, Russell averaged 20.7 points per game and 20.3 rebounds per game.[1] Besides basketball, Russell represented USF in track and field events. Russell was a standout in the high jump; he was ranked the seventh-best high-jumper in the world in 1956 (his graduation year) according to Track & Field News (this despite not competing in Olympic high-jump competition that year[8]).[25] That year, Russell won high jump titles at the Central California AAU meet, the Pacific AAU meet, and the West Coast Relays. One of his highest jumps occurred at the West Coast Relays, where he achieved a mark of 6 feet 9 1⁄4 inches (2.06 m);[26] at the meet Russell tied Charlie Dumas, who would later in the year both win gold in the Melbourne Olympics for the United States and become the first human to high-jump 7 feet (2.13 m).[27] Like fellow world-class high-jumpers of that era, Russell did not use the Fosbury Flop high-jump technique with which all high jump world records after 1978 have been set.[28][29] Russell also competed in the 440 yards (402.3 m) race, which he could complete in 49.6 seconds.[30] The Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to join their exhibition basketball squad. Russell, who was sensitive to any racial prejudice, was enraged by the fact that owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with Woolpert. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. Russell, however, was livid after this snub and declined the offer; he reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.[31] In the 1956 NBA draft, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach set his sights on Russell, thinking his defensive toughness and rebounding prowess were the missing pieces the Celtics needed.[1] In retrospect, Auerbach's thoughts were unorthodox. In that period, centers and forwards were defined by their offensive output, and their ability to play defense was secondary.[32] However, Boston's chances of getting Russell seemed slim. Because the Celtics had finished second in the previous season and the worst teams had the highest draft picks, the Celtics had slipped too low in the draft order to pick Russell. In addition, Auerbach had already used his territorial pick to acquire talented forward Tom Heinsohn. But Auerbach knew that the Rochester Royals, who owned the first draft pick, already had a skilled rebounder in Maurice Stokes, were looking for an outside shooting guard and were unwilling to pay Russell the $25,000 signing bonus he requested. Red Auerbach offered the Ice Capades if they didn't draft Russell number one. Rochester got their ice show.[33] The St. Louis Hawks, who owned the second pick, drafted Russell, but were vying for Celtics center Ed Macauley, a six-time All-Star who had roots in St. Louis. Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley, who had previously asked to be traded to St. Louis in order to be with his sick son, if the Hawks gave up Russell. The owner of St Louis called Auerbach later and demanded more in the trade. Not only did he want Macauley, who was the Celtics premier player at the time, he wanted Cliff Hagan, who had been serving in the military for three years and had not yet played for the Celtics. After much debate, Auerbach agreed to give up Hagan, and the Hawks made the trade.[34] During that same draft, Boston also drafted guard K. C. Jones, Russell's former USF teammate. Thus, in one night, the Celtics managed to draft three future Hall of Famers: Russell, Jones and Heinsohn.[1] The Russell draft-day trade was later called one of the most important trades in the history of North American sports.[33] Before his NBA rookie year, Russell was the captain of the U.S. national basketball team that competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics. Avery Brundage, head of the International Olympic Committee, argued that Russell had already signed a professional contract and thus was no longer an amateur, but Russell prevailed.[33] He had the option to skip the tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but he was determined to play in the Olympics. He later commented that he would have participated in the high jump if he had been snubbed by the basketball team.[8] Under head coach Gerald Tucker, Russell helped the national team win the gold medal in Melbourne, by defeating the Soviet Union 89–55 in the final game. The United States dominated the tournament, winning by an average of 53.5 points per game. Russell led the team in scoring, averaging 14.1 points per game for the competition.[35] His former USF and future Celtics teammate K. C. Jones, joined him on the Olympic squad and contributed 10.9 points per game.[36] Due to Russell's Olympic commitment, he could not join the Celtics for the 1956–57 season until December. After rejoining the Celtics, Russell played 48 games, averaging 14.7 points per game and a league-high 19.6 rebounds per game.[37] During this season, the Celtics featured five future Hall-of-Famers: center Russell, forwards Heinsohn and Frank Ramsey, and guards Bill Sharman and Bob Cousy. (K.C. Jones did not play for the Celtics until 1958 because of military service.)[38] Russell's first Celtics game came on December 22, 1956, against the St. Louis Hawks, led by star forward Bob Pettit, who held several all-time scoring records.[39] Auerbach assigned Russell to shut down the Hawks' main scorer, and the rookie impressed the Boston crowd with his man-to-man defense and shot-blocking.[39] In previous years, the Celtics had been a high-scoring team, but lacked the defensive presence needed to close out tight games. However, with the added defensive presence of Russell, the Celtics had laid the foundation for a dynasty. The team utilized a strong defensive approach to the game, forcing opposing teams to commit many turnovers, which led to many easy points on fast breaks.[39] Russell was an elite help defender who allowed the Celtics to play the so-called ""Hey, Bill"" defense: whenever a Celtic requested additional defensive help, he would shout ""Hey, Bill!"" Russell was so quick that he could run over for a quick double team and make it back in time if the opponents tried to find the open man.[39] He also became famous for his shot-blocking skills: pundits called his blocks ""Wilsonburgers"", referring to the Wilson NBA basketballs he ""shoved back into the faces of opposing shooters"".[39] This skill also allowed the other Celtics to play their men aggressively: if they were beaten, they knew that Russell was guarding the basket.[39] This approach allowed the Celtics to finish with a 44–28 regular season record, the team's second-best record since beginning play in the 1946–47 season, and guaranteed a post-season appearance.[40] However, Russell also received negative attention. Constantly provoked by New York Knicks center Ray Felix during a game, he complained to coach Auerbach. The latter told him to take matters into his own hands, so after the next provocation, Russell punched Felix unconscious, paid a $25 fine and was no longer a target of cheap fouls.[39] Russell had a cordial relationship with his teammates, with the notable exception of fellow rookie and old rival Heinsohn. Heinsohn felt that Russell resented him because the former was named the 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year. Many people thought that Russell was more important, but Russell had only played half the season. Russell also ignored Heinsohn's plea to give his cousin an autograph, and openly said to Heinsohn that he deserved half of his $300 Rookie of the Year check. The relationship between the two rookies remained reserved.[41] However, despite their different ethnic backgrounds and lack of common off-court interests, his relationship with Celtics point guard and fan favorite Bob Cousy was amicable.[42] In Game 1 of the Eastern Division Finals, the Celtics met the Syracuse Nationals, who were led by Dolph Schayes. In Russell's first NBA playoff game, he finished with 16 points and 31 rebounds, along with a reported 7 blocks. (At the time, blocks were not yet an officially registered statistic.) After the Celtics' 108–89 victory, Schayes quipped, ""How much does that guy make a year? It would be to our advantage if we paid him off for five years to get away from us in the rest of this series.""[32] The Celtics swept the Nationals in three games to earn the franchise's first appearance in the NBA Finals.[43] In the NBA Finals, the Celtics met the St. Louis Hawks, who were again led by Bob Pettit, as well as former Celtic Ed Macauley. The teams split the first six games, and the tension was so high that, in Game 3, Celtics coach Auerbach punched his colleague Ben Kerner and received a $300 fine.[41] In the highly competitive Game 7, Russell tried his best to slow down Pettit, but it was Heinsohn who scored 37 points and kept the Celtics alive.[41] However, Russell contributed by completing the famous ""Coleman Play"". Here, Russell ran down Hawks guard Jack Coleman, who had received an outlet pass at midcourt, and blocked his shot despite the fact that Russell had been standing at his own baseline when the ball was thrown to Coleman. The block preserved Boston's slim 103–102 lead with 40-odd seconds left to play in regulation, saving the game for the Celtics.[32] In the second overtime, both teams were in serious foul trouble: Heinsohn had fouled out, and the Hawks were so depleted that they had only 7 players left.[41] With the Celtics leading 125–123 with one second left, the Hawks had the ball at their own baseline. Reserve guard Alex Hannum threw a long alley oop pass to Pettit, and Pettit's tip-in rolled indecisively on the rim for several seconds before rolling out again. The Celtics won, earning their first NBA Championship.[41] At the start of the 1957–58 season, the Celtics won 14 straight games, and continued to succeed.[4] Russell averaged 16.6 points per game and a league-record average of 22.7 rebounds per game.[37] An interesting phenomenon began that year: Russell was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player, but only named to the All-NBA Second Team. This would occur repeatedly throughout his career. The NBA reasoned that other centers were better all-round players than Russell, but no player was more valuable to his team. The Celtics won 49 games and easily made the first berth in the 1958 NBA Playoffs, and made the 1958 NBA Finals against their familiar rivals, the St. Louis Hawks.[44] The teams split the first two games, but then Russell went down with a foot injury in Game 3 and only returned for Game 6. The Celtics surprisingly won Game 4, but the Hawks prevailed in Games 5 and 6, with Pettit scoring 50 points in the deciding Game 6.[44] In the following 1958–59 season, Russell continued his strong play, averaging 16.7 points per game and 23.0 rebounds per game in the regular season.[37] The Celtics broke a league record by winning 52 games, and Russell's strong performance once again helped lead the Celtics through the post-season, as they returned to the NBA Finals. In the 1959 NBA Finals, the Celtics recaptured the NBA title, sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers 4–0.[45] Lakers head coach John Kundla praised Russell, stating, ""We don't fear the Celtics without Bill Russell. Take him out and we can beat them ... He's the guy who whipped us psychologically.""[32] In the 1959–60 season, the NBA witnessed the debut of legendary 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) Philadelphia Warriors center Wilt Chamberlain, who averaged a record 37.6 points per game in his rookie year.[46] On November 7, 1959, Russell's Celtics hosted Chamberlain's Warriors, and pundits called the matchup between the best offensive and defensive centers ""The Big Collision"" and ""Battle of the Titans"".[47] Both men awed onlookers with ""nakedly awesome athleticism"",[47] and while Chamberlain outscored Russell 30 to 22, the Celtics won 115–106, and the match was called a ""new beginning of basketball"".[47] The matchup between Russell and Chamberlain became one of basketball's greatest rivalries.[1] On February 5, 1960, Russell grabbed 51 rebounds in a 124-100 win over the Syracuse Nationals.[48] It was the record for most rebounds in a single game until Chamberlain grabbed 55 rebounds. In that season, Russell's Celtics won a record 59 regular season games (including a then-record tying 17 game win streak) and met Chamberlain's Warriors in the Eastern Division Finals. Chamberlain outscored Russell by 81 points in the series, but the Celtics walked off with a 4–2 series win.[49] In the 1960 Finals, the Celtics outlasted the Hawks 4–3 and won their third championship in four years.[40] Russell grabbed an NBA Finals-record 40 rebounds in Game 2, and added 22 points and 35 rebounds in the deciding Game 7, a 122–103 victory for Boston.[1][32] In the 1960–61 season, Russell averaged 16.9 points and 23.9 rebounds per game,[37] leading his team to a regular season mark of 57–22. The Celtics earned another post-season appearance, where they defeated the Syracuse Nationals 4–1 in the Eastern Division Finals. The Celtics made good use of the fact that the Los Angeles Lakers had exhausted St. Louis in a long seven-game Western Conference Finals, and the Celtics convincingly won in five games.[50][51] The following season, Russell scored a career-high 18.9 points per game, accompanied by 23.6 rebounds per game.[37] While his rival Chamberlain had a record-breaking season of 50.4 points per game and a 100-point game,[46] the Celtics became the first team to win 60 games in a season, and Russell was voted as the NBA's Most Valuable Player. In the post-season, the Celtics met the Philadelphia Warriors of Chamberlain, and Russell did his best to slow down the 50-points-per-game scoring Warriors center. In the pivotal Game 7, Russell managed to hold Chamberlain to only 22 points (28 below his season average) while scoring 19 himself. The game was tied with two seconds left when Sam Jones sank a clutch shot that won the Celtics the series. In the 1962 NBA Finals, the Celtics met the Los Angeles Lakers of star forward Elgin Baylor and star guard Jerry West. The teams split the first six games. In Game 6, Russell recorded 19 points, 24 rebounds and 10 assists as the Celtics won 119-105.[52] In Game 7 was tied one second before the end of regular time when Lakers guard Rod Hundley faked a shot and instead passed out to Frank Selvy, who missed an open eight-foot last-second shot that would have won L.A. the title.[53] Though the game was tied, Russell had the daunting task of defending against Baylor with little frontline help, as the three best Celtics forwards, Loscutoff, Heinsohn and Tom Sanders, had fouled out. In overtime, Baylor fouled out the fourth forward, Frank Ramsey, so Russell was completely robbed of his usual four-men wing rotation. But Russell and little-used fifth forward Gene Guarilia successfully pressured Baylor into missed shots.[53][54] Russell finished with a clutch performance, scoring 30 points and tying his own NBA Finals record with 40 rebounds in a 110–107 overtime win.[32] The Celtics lost playmaker Bob Cousy to retirement after the 1962–63 season, but they drafted John Havlicek. Once again, the Celtics were powered by Russell, who averaged 16.8 points and 23.6 rebounds per game, won his fourth regular-season MVP title, and earned MVP honors at the 1963 NBA All-Star Game following his 19-point, 24-rebound performance for the East.[37] The Celtics reached the 1963 NBA Finals, where they again defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, this time in six games.[55] In the following 1963–64 season, the Celtics posted a league-best 58–22 record in the regular season. Russell scored 15.0 ppg and grabbed a career-high 24.7 rebounds per game, leading the NBA in rebounds for the first time since Chamberlain entered the league.[37] Boston defeated the Cincinnati Royals 4–1 to earn another NBA Finals appearance, and then won against Chamberlain's newly relocated San Francisco Warriors 4–1.[56] It was their sixth consecutive and seventh title in Russell's eighth year, a streak unreached in any U.S. professional sports league. Russell later called the Celtics' defense the best of all time.[1] Russell again excelled during the 1964–65 season. The Celtics won a league-record 62 games, and Russell averaged 14.1 points and 24.1 rebounds per game, winning his second consecutive rebounding title and his fifth MVP award.[37] In the 1965 NBA Playoffs, the Celtics played the Eastern Division Finals against the Philadelphia 76ers, who had recently traded for Wilt Chamberlain. Russell held Chamberlain to a pair of field goals in the first three quarters of Game 3. In Game 5, Russell contributed 28 rebounds, 10 blocks, seven assists and six steals.[32] However, that playoff series ended in a dramatic Game 7. Five seconds before the end, the Sixers were trailing 110–109, but Russell turned over the ball. However, when the Sixers' Hall-of-Fame guard Hal Greer inbounded, John Havlicek stole the ball, causing Celtics commentator Johnny Most to scream: ""Havlicek stole the ball! It's all over! Johnny Havlicek stole the ball!""[1] After the Division Finals, the Celtics had an easier time in the NBA Finals, winning 4–1 against the Los Angeles Lakers of Jerry West and Elgin Baylor.[57] In the following 1965–66 season, the Celtics won their eighth consecutive title. Russell's team again beat Chamberlain's Philadelphia 76ers 4 games to 1 in the Division Finals, proceeding to win the NBA Finals in a tight seven-game showdown against the Los Angeles Lakers, with Russell scoring 25 points and grabbing 32 rebounds in a 95–93 win in the deciding seventh game.[58] During the season, Russell contributed 12.9 points and 22.8 rebounds per game. This was the first time in seven years that he failed to average at least 23 rebounds a game.[37] Celtics coach Red Auerbach retired before the 1966–67 season. He had initially wanted his old player Frank Ramsey to coach the Celtics, but Ramsey was too occupied running his three lucrative nursing homes.[60] His second choice was Bob Cousy, who declined the invitation, stating that he did not want to coach his former teammates.[60] Third choice Tom Heinsohn also said no, because he did not think he could handle the often surly Russell.[60] However, Heinsohn proposed Russell himself as a player-coach, and when Auerbach asked his center, he said yes.[60] On April 16, 1966, Bill Russell agreed to become head coach of the Boston Celtics; a public announcement was made two days later.[61] Russell thus became the first black head coach in NBA history[1] and commented to journalists: ""I wasn't offered the job because I am a Negro, I was offered it because Red figured I could do it.""[60] The Celtics' championship streak ended at eight in his first full season as head coach when Wilt Chamberlain's Philadelphia 76ers won a record-breaking 68 regular season games and beat the Celtics 4–1 in the 1967 Eastern Finals.[62] The Sixers simply outpaced the Celtics when they shredded the famed Boston defense by scoring 140 points in the clinching Game 5 win.[63] Russell acknowledged the first real loss of his career (he had been injured in 1958 when the Celtics lost the NBA Finals) by visiting Chamberlain in the locker room, shaking his hand and saying, ""Great"".[63] However, the game still ended on a high note for Russell. After the loss, he led his grandfather through the Celtics locker rooms, and the two saw white Celtics player John Havlicek taking a shower next to his black teammate Sam Jones and discussing the game. Suddenly, Jake Russell broke down crying. Asked by his grandson what was wrong, his grandfather replied how proud he was of him, being coach of an organization in which blacks and whites coexisted in harmony.[63] In Russell's penultimate season of 1967–68, his numbers slowly declined, but at age 34, he still tallied 12.5 points per game and 18.6 rebounds per game[37] (the latter good for the third highest average in the league).[64] In the Eastern Division Finals, the 76ers had the better record than the Celtics and were slightly favored. But then, national tragedy struck as Martin Luther King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. With eight of the ten starting players on Sixers and Celtics being black, both teams were in deep shock, and there were calls to cancel the series.[65] In a game called as ""unreal"" and ""devoid of emotion"", the Sixers lost 127–118 on April 5. In Game 2, Philadelphia evened the series with a 115–106 win, and in Games 3 and 4, the Sixers won, with Chamberlain suspiciously often defended by Celtics backup center Wayne Embry, causing the press to speculate Russell was worn down.[65] Prior to Game 5, the Celtics seemed dead: no NBA team had ever come back from a 3–1 deficit.[65] However, the Celtics rallied back, winning Game 5 122–104 and Game 6 114–106, powered by a spirited Havlicek and helped by a terrible Sixers shooting slump.[65] In Game 7, 15,202 stunned Philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100–96 defeat, making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading 3–1. Russell limited Chamberlain to only two shot attempts in the second half.[32] Despite this, the Celtics were leading only 97–95 with 34 seconds left when Russell closed out the game with several consecutive clutch plays. He made a free throw, blocked a shot by Sixers player Chet Walker, grabbed a rebound off a miss by Sixers player Hal Greer, and finally passed the ball to teammate Sam Jones, who scored to clinch the win. Boston then beat the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2 in the NBA Finals, giving Russell his tenth title in 12 years.[1] For his efforts Russell was named Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year. After losing for the fifth straight time against Russell and his Celtics, Hall-of-Fame Lakers guard Jerry West stated, ""If I had a choice of any basketball player in the league, my No.1 choice has to be Bill Russell. Bill Russell never ceases to amaze me.""[32] However, Russell seemed to reach a breaking point during the 1968–69 season. He was shocked by the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, disillusioned by the Vietnam War, and weary from his increasingly stale marriage to his wife Rose; the couple later divorced. He was convinced that the U.S. was a corrupt nation and that he was wasting his time playing something as superficial as basketball.[66] He was 15 pounds overweight, skipped mandatory NBA coach meetings and was generally lacking energy: after a New York Knicks game, he complained of intense pain and was diagnosed with acute exhaustion.[66] Russell pulled himself together and put up 9.9 points and 19.3 rebounds per game,[37] but the aging Celtics stumbled through the regular season. Their 48–34 record was the team's worst since 1955–56, and they entered the playoffs as only the fourth-seeded team in the East.[67] In the playoffs, however, Russell and his Celtics achieved upsets over the Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks to earn a meeting with the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. L.A. now featured new recruit Wilt Chamberlain next to perennial stars Baylor and West, and were heavily favored. In the first two games, Russell ordered not to double-team West, who used the freedom to score 53 and 41 points in the Game 1 and 2 Laker wins.[68] Russell then ordered to double-team West, and Boston won Game 3. In Game 4, the Celtics were trailing by one point with seven seconds left and the Lakers having the ball, but then Baylor stepped out of bounds, and in the last play, Sam Jones used a triple screen by Bailey Howell, Larry Siegfried and Havlicek and hit a buzzer beater which equalized the series.[68] The teams split the next two games, so it all came down to Game 7 in L.A., where Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke angered and motivated the Celtics by putting ""proceedings of Lakers victory ceremony"" on the game leaflets. Russell used a copy as extra motivation and told his team to play a running game, because in that case, not the better, but the more determined team was going to win.[68] The Celtics were ahead by nine points with five minutes remaining; in addition, West was heavily limping after a Game 5 thigh injury and Chamberlain had left the game with an injured leg.[68] West then hit one basket after the other and cut the lead to one, and Chamberlain asked to return to the game. However, Lakers coach Bill van Breda Kolff kept Chamberlain on the bench until the end of the game, saying later that he wanted to stay with the lineup responsible for the comeback.[46][69] The Celtics held on for a 108–106 victory, and Russell claimed his eleventh championship in 13 years. At age 35, Russell contributed 21 rebounds in his last NBA game.[32] After the game, Russell went over to the distraught West (who had scored 42 points and was named the only NBA Finals MVP in history from the losing team), clasped his hand and tried to soothe him.[68] Days later, 30,000 enthusiastic Celtics fans cheered their returning heroes, but Russell was not there: the man who said he owed the public nothing ended his career and cut all ties to the Celtics.[68] It came as so surprising that even Red Auerbach was blindsided, and as a consequence, he made the ""mistake"" of drafting guard Jo Jo White instead of a center.[70] Although White became a standout Celtics player, the Celtics lacked an All-Star center, went just 34–48 in the next season and failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 1950.[40] In Boston, both fans and journalists felt betrayed, because Russell left the Celtics without a coach and a center and sold his retirement story for $10,000 to Sports Illustrated. Russell was accused of selling out the future of the franchise for a month of his salary.[70] Russell's No. 6 jersey was retired by the Celtics on March 12, 1972,[71] Russell had worn the same number 6 at the University of San Francisco and for the 1956 USA Olympic Team.[72] He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975. Russell, who had a difficult relationship with the media, did not attend either ceremony.[73] After retiring as a player, Russell had stints as head coach of the Seattle SuperSonics (1973 to 1977) and Sacramento Kings (1987 to 1988). His time as a non-player coach was lackluster; although he led the struggling SuperSonics into the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, Russell's defensive, team-oriented Celtics mindset did not mesh well with the team, and he left in 1977 with a 162–166 record. Russell's stint with the Kings was considerably shorter, his last assignment ending when the Kings went 17–41 to begin the 1987–88 season.[74] In addition, Russell ran into financial trouble. He had invested $250,000 in a rubber plantation in Liberia, where he had wanted to spend his retirement, but it went bankrupt.[75] The same fate awaited his Boston restaurant called ""Slade's"", after which he had to default on a $90,000 government loan to purchase the outlet. The IRS discovered that Russell owed $34,430 in tax money and put a lien on his house.[76] Russell became a vegetarian, took up golf and worked as a color commentator for CBS and TBS throughout the 1970s into the mid-1980s, but he was uncomfortable as a broadcaster. He later said, ""The most successful television is done in eight-second thoughts, and the things I know about basketball, motivation, and people go deeper than that.""[1][76] On November 3, 1979, Russell hosted Saturday Night Live, in which he appeared in several sports-related sketches. Russell also wrote books, usually written as a joint project with a professional writer, including 1979's Second Wind. In 1986 Russell played Judge Roger Ferguson in the Miami Vice episode ""The Fix"" (aired March 7, 1986). After spending about a decade living as a recluse on Mercer Island near Seattle, Russell rose to prominence again at the turn of the millennium.[77] Russell's Rules was published in 2001, and in January 2006, he convinced Miami Heat superstar center Shaquille O'Neal to bury the hatchet with fellow NBA superstar and former Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant, with whom O'Neal had a bitter public feud.[78] Later that year, on November 17, 2006, the two-time NCAA winner Russell was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five, along with John Wooden, Oscar Robertson, Dean Smith and Dr. James Naismith, selected to represent the inaugural class.[79] On May 20, 2007, Russell was awarded an honorary doctorate by Suffolk University, where he served as its commencement speaker, and Russell received an honorary degree from Harvard University on June 7, 2007. On June 18, 2007, Russell was inducted as a member of the founding class of the FIBA Hall of Fame. Russell was also honored during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix. On February 14, 2009, NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award would be renamed the ""Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"" in honor of the 11-time NBA champion.[80] The following day, during halftime of the All-Star game, Celtics captains Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen presented Russell a surprise birthday cake for his 75th birthday.[81] Russell attended the final game of the Finals that year to present his newly christened namesake award to its winner, Kobe Bryant.[82][83] Russell was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.[84] Russell is one of the most successful and decorated athletes in North American sports history. His awards and achievements include 11 NBA championships as a player with the Boston Celtics in 13 seasons (including two NBA championships as player/head coach), and he is credited with having raised defensive play in the NBA to a new level.[85] By winning the 1956 NCAA Championship with USF and the 1957 NBA title with the Celtics, Russell became the first of only four players in basketball history to win an NCAA championship and an NBA Championship back-to-back (the others being Henry Bibby, Magic Johnson, and Billy Thompson). He also won two state championships in high school. In the interim, Russell won an Olympic gold medal in 1956. His stint as coach of the Celtics was also of historical significance, as he became the first black head coach in major U.S. professional sports when he succeeded Red Auerbach.[86] In his first NBA full season (1957–58), Russell became the first player in NBA history to average more than 20 rebounds per game for an entire season, a feat he accomplished 10 times in his 13 seasons. Russell's 51 rebounds in a single game is the second-highest performance ever, trailing only Chamberlain's all-time record of 55. He still holds the NBA record for rebounds in one half with 32 (vs. Philadelphia, on November 16, 1957). Career-wise in rebounds, Russell ranks second to Wilt Chamberlain in regular season total (21,620) and average per game (22.5), and he led the NBA in average rebounds per game four times. Russell is the all-time playoff leader in total (4,104) and average (24.9) rebounds per game, he grabbed 40 rebounds in three separate playoff games (twice in the NBA Finals), and he never failed to average at least 20 rebounds per game in any of his 13 post-season campaigns. Russell also had seven regular season games with 40 or more rebounds, the NBA Finals record for highest rebound per game average (29.5 rpg, 1959) and by a rookie (22.9 rpg, 1957). In addition, Russell holds the NBA Finals single-game record for most rebounds (40, March 29, 1960, vs. St. Louis, and April 18, 1962, vs. Los Angeles), most rebounds in a quarter (19, April 18, 1962 vs. Los Angeles), and most consecutive games with 20 or more rebounds (15 from April 9, 1960 – April 16, 1963).[87] He also had 51 in one game, 49 in two others, and twelve straight seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds.[1] Russell was known as one of the most clutch players in the NBA. He played in 11 deciding games (10 times in Game 7s, once in a Game 5), and ended with a flawless 11–0 record. In these eleven games, Russell averaged 18 points and 29.45 rebounds.[32] On the hardwood, he was considered the consummate defensive center, noted for his unmatched defensive intensity, his stellar basketball IQ and his sheer will to win.[32] Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds.[1] Opponent Wilt Chamberlain said Russell's timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled.[88] Bill Bradley—Russell's erstwhile Knicks opponent—wrote in 2009 that Russell ""was the smartest player ever to play the game [of basketball]"".[89] He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast break points.[1] He also was known as a fine passer and pick-setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot and finished strong on alley oops.[32] However, on offense, Russell's output was limited. His NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he was never the focal point of the Celtics offense, instead focusing on his tremendous defense.[37] In his career, Russell won five regular season MVP awards (1959, 1961–63, 1965)—tied with Michael Jordan for second all-time behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six awards. He was selected three times to the All-NBA First Teams (1959, 1963, 1965) and eight Second Teams (1958, 1960–62, 1964, 1966–68), and was a twelve-time NBA All-Star (1958–1969). Russell was elected to one NBA All-Defensive First Team. This took place during his last season (1969), and was the first season the NBA All-Defensive Teams were selected. In 1970, The Sporting News named Russell the ""Athlete of the Decade"". Russell is universally seen as one of the best NBA players ever,[1] and was declared ""Greatest Player in the History of the NBA"" by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America in 1980.[1] For his achievements, Russell was named ""Sportsman of the Year"" by Sports Illustrated in 1968. He also made all three NBA Anniversary Teams: the NBA 25th Anniversary All-Time Team (1970), the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team (1980) and the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team (1996). Russell ranked #18 on ESPN's 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century in 1999. In 2009, SLAM Magazine named Russell the #3 player of all time behind Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain.[90] Former NBA player and head coach, Don Nelson, described Russell as follows: ""There are two types of superstars. One makes himself look good at the expense of the other guys on the floor. But there's another type who makes the players around him look better than they are, and that's the type Russell was.""[91] On Saturday, February 14, 2009, during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the NBA Finals MVP Award would be named after Bill Russell.[80] Russell was named as a 2010 recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[92] On June 15, 2017, Russell was announced as the inaugural recipient of the NBA Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2000, his longtime teammate Tommy Heinsohn described both Russell's stature and his uneasy relationship with Boston more earthily: ""Look, all I know is the guy...came to Boston and won 11 championships in 13 years, and they named a fucking tunnel after Ted Williams.""[93] Boston honored Russell by erecting a statue of him on City Hall Plaza in 2013: he is depicted in-game, surrounded by 11 plinths representing the 11 championships he helped the Celtics win.[94] Each plinth features a key word and related quote to illustrate Russell's multiple accomplishments. The Bill Russell Legacy Foundation, established by the Boston Celtics Shamrock Foundation, funded the project.[95] The art is by Ann Hirsch of Somerville, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston. The statue was unveiled on November 1, 2013, with Russell in attendance.[96][97][98][99] Russell was married to his college sweetheart Rose Swisher from 1956 to 1973. They had three children, namely daughter Karen Russell, the television pundit and lawyer, and sons William Jr. and Jacob. However, the couple grew emotionally distant and divorced.[100] In 1977, he married Dorothy Anstett, Miss USA of 1968,[100] but they divorced in 1980. The relationship was shrouded in controversy because Anstett was white.[101] In 1996, Russell married his third wife, Marilyn Nault;[102] their marriage lasted until her death in January 2009.[103] As of July 2019, Russell is married to Jeannine Russell.[104] He has been a resident of Mercer Island, Washington for over four decades.[105] His older brother was the noted playwright Charlie L. Russell.[106] In 1959, Russell became the first NBA player to visit Africa.[107] Russell is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, having been initiated into its Gamma Alpha chapter while a student at University of San Francisco.[108] On October 16, 2013, Russell was arrested for bringing a loaded .38-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun to the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.[109] During his career, Russell was one of the first big earners in NBA basketball. His 1956 rookie contract was worth $24,000, only fractionally smaller than the $25,000 of top earner Bob Cousy.[39] Russell never had to work part-time. This was in contrast to other Celtics who had to work during the offseason to maintain their standard of living. Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Auerbach invested in plastics and a Chinese restaurant.[110] When Wilt Chamberlain became the first NBA player to earn $100,000 in salary in 1965, Russell went to Auerbach and demanded a $100,001 salary, which he promptly received.[111][112] For his promotion to coach, the Celtics paid Russell an annual salary of $25,000 which was in addition to his salary as a player. Although the salary was touted in the press as a record for an NBA coach, it is unclear whether Russell's continued $100,001 salary as a player was included in the calculation.[113] In 1966, The New York Times wrote ""Russell's main characteristics are pride, intelligence, an active and appreciative sense of humor, a preoccupation with dignity, a capacity for consideration once his friendship or sympathy has been aroused, and an unwillingness to compromise whatever truths he has accepted.""[114] Russell himself in 2009 wrote his paternal grandfather's motto, passed down to his father and then to him is: ""A man has to draw a line inside himself that he won't allow any man to cross""; Russell was ""proud of my Grandfather's heroic dignity against forces more powerful than him... he would not allow himself to be oppressed or intimidated by anyone""; he wrote these words after recounting how that grandfather stood up to the Ku Klux Klan and whites who attempted to thwart his efforts to build a schoolhouse for black children (Jake Russell was the first person in Bill Russell's patrilineal line born free in North America, and was himself illiterate[115]).[116] Thus Bill Russell's motto became ""If you disrespect that line, you disrespect me.""[117] Russell was driven by ""a neurotic need to win"", as his Celtic teammate Heinsohn observed.[75] He was so tense before every game that he regularly vomited in the locker room; early in his career it happened so frequently that his fellow Celtics were more worried when it did not happen.[118] Later in Russell's career, Havlicek said of his teammate and coach that he threw up less often than early in his career, only doing so ""when it's an important game or an important challenge for him—someone like Chamberlain, or someone coming up that everyone's touting. [The sound of Russell throwing up] is a welcome sound, too, because it means he's keyed up for the game, and around the locker room we grin and say, ""Man, we're going to be all right tonight.""[119] In a retrospective interview, Russell described the state of mind he felt he needed to enter in order to be able to play basketball as, ""I had to almost be in a rage. Nothing went on outside the borders[] of the court. I could hear anything, I could see anything, and nothing mattered. And I could anticipate every move that every player made.""[120] Russell was also known for his natural authority. When he became player-coach in 1966, Russell bluntly said to his teammates that ""he intended to cut all personal ties to other players"", and seamlessly made the transition from their peer to their superior.[121] Russell, at the time his additional role of coach was announced, publicly stated he believed Auerbach's (who he regarded as the greatest of all coaches) impact as a coach confined every or almost every relationship with each Celtic player to a strictly professional one.[122] Russell was known for his distinctive high-pitched laugh (hear at [123]) of which Auerbach quipped: ""There are only two things that could make me quit coaching[:] My wife and Russell's laugh.""[124] To teammates and friends, Russell was open and amicable, but was extremely distrusting and cold towards anyone else.[75] Journalists were often treated to the ""Russell Glower"", described as an ""icily contemptuous stare accompanied by a long silence"".[75] Russell was also notorious for his refusal to give autographs or even acknowledge the Celtics fans, and was called ""the most selfish, surly and uncooperative athlete"" by one pundit.[75] For most of his career, Russell and his perennial opponent Wilt Chamberlain were close friends. Chamberlain often invited Russell over for Thanksgiving dinner, and at Russell's place, conversation mostly concerned Russell's electric trains.[125] However, the close relationship ended after Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals, when Chamberlain injured his knee with six minutes left and was forced to leave the game. During a conversation with students, a reporter—unknown to Russell—heard Russell describe Chamberlain as a malingerer and accused him of ""copping out"" of the game when it seemed that the Lakers would lose.[126] Chamberlain was livid with Russell and saw him as a backstabber.[126] Chamberlain's knee was injured so badly that he could not play the entire offseason and he ruptured it the next season. The two men did not speak to each other for more than 20 years until Russell finally met with Chamberlain and personally apologized.[127] After that, the two were often seen together at various events and interviewed as friends. When Chamberlain died in 1999, Chamberlain's nephew said that Russell was the second person he was told to call.[8] At Chamberlain's eulogy, Russell stated that he did not consider them to be rivals, but rather to have a competition, and that the pair would ""be friends through eternity.""[128] Russell's life was marked by an uphill battle against racism and controversial actions and statements in response to perceived racism. As a child, the young Russell witnessed how his parents were victims of racial abuse, and the family eventually moved into government housing projects to escape the daily torrent of bigotry.[6] When he later became a standout college player at USF, Russell recalled how he and his few fellow black teammates were jeered by white students.[21] Even after he became a star with the Boston Celtics, Russell was the victim of racial abuse. When the NBA All-Stars toured the U.S. in the 1958 offseason, white hotel owners in segregated North Carolina denied rooms to Russell and his black teammates, causing him to later write in his memoir Go Up for Glory, ""It stood out, a wall which understanding cannot penetrate. You are a Negro. You are less. It covered every area. A living, smarting, hurting, smelling, greasy substance which covered you. A morass to fight from.""[42] Before the 1961–62 season, Russell's team was scheduled to play in an exhibition game in Lexington, Kentucky, when Russell and his black teammates were refused service at a local restaurant. He and the other black teammates refused to play in the exhibition game and flew home, drawing a great deal of controversy and publicity.[73] As a consequence, Russell was extremely sensitive to all racial prejudice: according to Taylor, he often perceived insults even if others did not.[31] He was active in the Black Power movement and supported Muhammad Ali's decision to refuse to be drafted.[129] He was often called ""Felton X"", presumably in the tradition of the Nation of Islam's practice of replacing a European slave name with an ""X"", and even purchased land in Liberia.[75] Russell's public statements became increasingly militant, and he was quoted in a 1963 Sports Illustrated interview with the words: ""I dislike most white people because they are people ... I like most blacks because I am black""; however, Russell articulated these views with a measure of self-criticism: ""I consider this a deficiency in myself—maybe. If I looked at it objectively, detached myself, it would be a deficiency.""[75][124] However, when his white Celtics teammate Frank Ramsey asked whether he hated him, Russell claimed to have been misquoted, but few believed it.[75] According to Taylor, Russell discounted the fact that his career was facilitated by white people who were proven anti-racists: his high school coach George Powles (the person who encouraged him to play basketball), his college coach Phil Woolpert (who integrated USF basketball), Celtics coach Red Auerbach (who is regarded as an anti-racist pioneer and made him the first black NBA coach), and Celtics owner Walter A. Brown, who gave him a high $24,000 rookie contract, just $1,000 shy of the top earning veteran Bob Cousy.[76] However, Russell in the above-quoted 1963 Sports Illustrated article said he had ""never met a finer person [than George Powles]... I owe so much to him it's impossible to express.""[124] Years after Taylor's book, Russell published an autobiographical account, Red and Me which chronicled his lifelong friendship with Auerbach. Bill Bradley for the New York Times Book Review wrote of Red and Me, ""Bill Russell is a private, complex man, but on the subject of his love of Red Auerbach and his Celtic teammates, he's loud and clear.""[89] In the book itself Russell wrote ""Whenever I leave the Celtics locker room, even Heaven wouldn't be good enough because anywhere else is a step down... With Red [Auerbach] and Walter Brown, I was the freest athlete on the planet. I could always be myself with them and they were always there for me.""[130] Describing the Celtics organization (as distinguished from Boston sports fans in the 1950s and 1960s) as very progressive racially, Russell in 2010 recalled a list of the organization's accomplishments on racial progress both in terms of objective milestones and his own subjective experience as a member of the organization:[131] In 1966, Russell was promoted to head coach of the Boston Celtics. During a press conference, Russell was asked: ""As the first Negro head coach in a major league sport, can you do the job impartially without any racial prejudice in reverse?"" He replied ""Yes."" The reporter asked, ""How?"" Russell replied, ""Because the most important factor is respect. And in basketball I respect a man for his ability, period.""[61][132] As a result of repeated racial bigotry, Russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors, thinking it was insincere and hypocritical. This attitude contributed to his legendarily bad rapport with fans and journalists.[42] He alienated Celtics fans by saying, ""You owe the public the same it owes you, nothing! I refuse to smile and be nice to the kiddies.""[75] This supported the opinion of many white fans that Russell (who was by then the highest-paid Celtic) was egotistical, paranoid and hypocritical. The already hostile atmosphere between Russell and Boston hit its apex when vandals broke into his house, covered the walls with racist graffiti, damaged his trophies and defecated in the beds.[75] In response, Russell described Boston as a ""flea market of racism"".[133] In King Of The Court by Aram Goudsouzian, he was quoted saying, ""From my very first year I thought of myself as playing for the Celtics, not for Boston. The fans could do or think whatever they wanted.""[134] Referring to a time when the Celtics could not sell out the Boston Garden, Russell recalled ""We [the Celtics] did a survey about what we could do to improve attendance. Over 50 percent of responses said 'There's too many black players.'""[135] In retirement, Russell described the Boston press as corrupt and racist; in response, Boston sports journalist Larry Claflin claimed that Russell himself was the real racist.[136] The FBI maintained a file on Russell, and described him in their file as ""an arrogant Negro who won't sign autographs for white children"".[75][137] Russell refused to attend the ceremony when his jersey #6 was retired in 1972; he also refused to attend his induction into the Hall of Fame in 1975.[73] While Russell still has sore feelings towards Boston, there has been something of a reconciliation;[138] on November 15, 2019 Russell did accept the Hall of fame ring in a private ceremony with family,[139] and he has even visited the city regularly in recent years, something he never did in the years immediately after his retirement.[138] When Russell originally retired, he demanded that his jersey be retired in an empty Boston Garden.[140] In 1995, the Celtics left Boston Garden and entered the FleetCenter, now the TD Garden, and as the main festive act, the Boston organization wanted to re-retire Russell's jersey in front of a sellout audience.[76] Perennially wary of what he long perceived as a racist city, Russell decided to make amends and gave his approval. On May 6, 1999, the Celtics re-retired Russell's jersey in a ceremony attended by his on-court rival (and friend) Chamberlain, along with Celtics legend Larry Bird and Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The crowd gave Russell a prolonged standing ovation, which brought tears to his eyes.[140] He thanked Chamberlain for taking him to the limit and ""making [him] a better player"" and the crowd for ""allowing [him] to be a part of their lives.""[76] In December 2008, the We Are Boston Leadership Award was presented to Russell.[141] On September 26, 2017, Russell posted a photograph of himself to a previously unused Twitter account in which he was taking a knee in solidarity with NFL players kneeling during the US national anthem. Russell wore his Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the image was captioned with ""Proud to take a knee, and to stand tall against social injustice."" In an interview with ESPN, Russell said he wanted the NFL players to know they weren't alone.[142]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/255.png

During his career, he coached the Minnesota Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons, and Washington Wizards.[2] Saunders was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He was an All-state basketball player at Cuyahoga Heights High School in suburban Cleveland.[3] In his senior season, 1973, he was named Ohio's Class A High School Basketball Player of the Year, leading the state in scoring average with 32.0 points per game.[3] At the University of Minnesota, he started 101 of his 103 career contests and as a senior, teamed with Ray Williams, Mychal Thompson, Kevin McHale, and Osborne Lockhart. Saunders began his coaching career at Golden Valley Lutheran College where he compiled a 92–13 record, including a perfect 56–0 mark at home, in four seasons. In 1981, he became an assistant coach at his alma mater, Minnesota, and helped guide the Golden Gophers to the Big Ten championship that season. After five seasons at Minnesota, he became an assistant coach at the University of Tulsa where he worked for two seasons before heading to the pro ranks. Saunders became the coach of the Rapid City Thrillers of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) in the 1988–89 season, where future Kings and Warriors head coach Eric Musselman served as the team's general manager. Musselman's father, Bill Musselman, had recruited Flip when Bill was head coach at the University of Minnesota.[citation needed] Saunders then later moved to the La Crosse Catbirds for five seasons (1989–94), where he won two CBA Championships, before coaching in 1994–95 with the Sioux Falls Skyforce. He also served as general manager (1991–93) and team president (1991–94) of the Catbirds. Saunders' impressive CBA tenure included seven consecutive seasons of 30 or more victories, two CBA championships (1990, 1992), two CBA Coach of the Year honors (1989, 1992) and 23 CBA-to-NBA player promotions. Saunders would leave after seven productive seasons as a head coach in the CBA, where he ranks second with 253 career victories. Saunders joined the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA) on May 11, 1995 as general manager, working under his former Minnesota teammate, Kevin McHale. On December 18, 1995, Saunders was named head coach of the Timberwolves, replacing Bill Blair. This happened shortly after McHale had taken over the basketball operations for the Timberwolves. He then added the coaching duties to his GM responsibilities after the team had gotten off to a 6–14 start. The Timberwolves went 20–42 the rest of the year, but the emergence of young Kevin Garnett as a front-line NBA player was a huge plus over the second half of the season. He guided with difficulty the Timberwolves to their first-ever playoff berth in the 1996–97 season, his first full season as an NBA head coach. A year later, he led the Timberwolves to their first-ever winning season. They went on to a franchise-record 50 victories in 1999–2000 which was duplicated in 2001–2002. After the Timberwolves' success in the 2003–04 NBA season, in which they won their first (and to date, only) division title and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, they struggled in the 2004–05 season. On February 12, 2005, McHale fired Saunders and named himself head coach for the rest of the season. McHale was unable to right the ship, and the Wolves missed the playoffs for the first time in nine years. Many fans believed that Saunders' firing was unwarranted, citing instead the contract troubles of Sam Cassell and Latrell Sprewell as the reasons for the team's failure. However, many also acknowledged that Saunders had coached ten years in Minnesota, and perhaps a new voice was needed. Saunders replaced Larry Brown as coach of the Detroit Pistons on July 21, 2005.[4] Under Saunders, the team set a new franchise record for wins during the regular season, finishing with a 64–18 record. Saunders coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas. Saunders led the Pistons to three consecutive Central Division titles and three consecutive appearances in the Eastern Conference Finals. Upon entering his third season as Pistons coach, Saunders became the longest-tenured Pistons coach since Chuck Daly's nine-year tenure (1983–1992). Saunders was fired June 3, 2008 after the Pistons lost to the Boston Celtics in the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals; Detroit president of basketball operations Joe Dumars said the team needed a ""new voice"".[5] On April 14, 2009, Saunders reached an agreement to become the new coach of the Washington Wizards.[6][7] The deal was reportedly worth $18 million over 4 years. On January 24, 2012, Saunders was fired as the coach of the Wizards. Replaced by former Minnesota Timberwolves head coach Randy Wittman, Saunders departed the Wizards with a record of 51–130.[8] On June 6, 2014, Saunders was named the head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, returning to the franchise for a second stint.[9] During his second stint with the Timberwolves, Saunders was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. During his recovery, he delegated his coaching position to assistant coach and former NBA Coach of the Year winner Sam Mitchell. His 427 wins during parts of ten seasons in two stints are far and away the most in franchise history and, until the 2017-18 season, he was the only coach to lead the Timberwolves to a winning season or coach a playoff game. On April 29, 2012, Saunders joined the Boston Celtics as an advisor. On May 3, 2013, Saunders was named the Timberwolves' President of Basketball Operations. On June 5, 2014, Saunders was named head coach as well.[10] During his recovery from Hodgkin's Lymphoma, he delegated his duties within the front office to the team's general manager Milt Newton. Saunders and his wife Debbie[11] had four children. Their son, Ryan, was a 6-foot-1 guard for the University of Minnesota, Flip’s alma mater, and later became an NBA assistant coach for the Wizards and Wolves, and the head coach of the Wolves. His daughter, Mindy also attended the University of Minnesota and was a member of the dance team.[12] Flip's twin daughters, Kim and Rachel, also attended the University of Minnesota. Together, they danced on the University of Minnesota Dance Team for 4 years - winning 8 national championships and a World Championship.[13] According to Saunders, he was about 20 yards (18 m) (60 feet) away from the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse on August 1, 2007 in Minneapolis.[14] On August 11, 2015, Saunders announced he had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma,[15][16] for which he was undergoing treatment. Saunders planned to remain the Timberwolves' head coach and president. However, after being hospitalized for more than a month following complications in September, [17][18] team owner Glen Taylor announced that Saunders would miss the next season. [19] Saunders died on October 25, 2015 at the age of 60. [20][21] On February 15, 2018, the Timberwolves held a ""Flip Saunders Night"" during which a permanent banner was unveiled in the Target Center honoring Saunders. A little over three years after his death, Flip's son Ryan Saunders took over as the Timberwolves' head coach following the firing of Tom Thibodeau. On January 4, 2020, the south gymnasium at Cuyahoga Heights High School in Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio was renamed in Flip's honor.

On January 6, 2019, Saunders was promoted to interim head coach of the Timberwolves after Tom Thibodeau was fired,[7] also becoming the youngest head coach in the NBA for the 2018–19 season.[8] On January 8, Saunders got his first win in his debut as head coach when the Timberwolves defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder,[9] and became the youngest head coach to win in his debut since 1978.[10] On May 20, the Timberwolves announced that Saunders signed to a multi-year deal to become the team's permanent head coach, removing his ""interim"" status.[11] At age 33, Saunders became the youngest head coach in the league, despite having over 10 years of NBA experience under his belt.[12] When Saunders was born, his father Flip Saunders was an assistant coach at the University of Minnesota.[13] Ryan Saunders grew up in Wisconsin and South Dakota, as Flip later worked as head coach for CBA teams in those states (specifically, the Rapid City Thrillers (1988–1989), La Crosse Catbirds (1989–1994), and Sioux Falls Skyforce (1994–1995)). In 1995, the Saunders family returned to the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area when Flip Saunders became head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, a position he would maintain for the rest of Ryan's childhood.[14] Saunders married his wife Hayley in 2017. Their son Lucas Philip Saunders was born on June 6th, 2019.[15] Lucas's middle name is a dedication to Ryan's father, the late Flip Saunders. Saunders has taken part in multiple basketball camps for the youth and charitable organizations in Minnesota.[16]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/261.png

He was born in Newark, Ohio.[1] Schaus played basketball at West Virginia, where he earned the record of first to score 1,000 career points (1,009). He was also selected to the All-American team in 1949. Schaus left West Virginia to join the Fort Wayne Pistons in the 1949–1950 season. He scored 14.3 points a game and a year later scored a career-best 15.3 points a game. He was selected to play in the first NBA All-Star Game and scored eight points for the West. However, he only averaged 14.1 points per game in 1952, and then in 1953 it dropped to 10.1 points per game. He was traded to the New York Knicks halfway through the 1954 season and ended his NBA career that season with 7.1 points per game average.

A top scorer and rebounder, he was a 12-time NBA All-Star and a 12-time All-NBA selection. Schayes won an NBA championship with the Syracuse Nationals in 1955.[1] He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Schayes played his entire career with the Nationals and their successor, the Philadelphia 76ers, from 1948 to 1964.[2] In his 16-year career, he led his team into the playoffs 15 times.[3] After the Nationals moved to Philadelphia, Schayes became player-coach of the newly-minted 76ers. He retired after the 1963-64 season and stayed on as coach for two more seasons, earning NBA Coach of the Year honors in 1966. He briefly coached with the Buffalo Braves. Schayes was born in the Bronx, New York, the son of Tina (née Michel), a homemaker, and Carl Schayes, a truck driver for Consolidated Laundries.[4] His parents were Romanian-Jewish immigrants.[5] He grew up on Davidson Avenue and 183rd Street, near Jerome Avenue in University Heights, Bronx.[6] He attended Creston Junior High School 79 and DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, New York, where he played for the basketball team and led it to a borough championship.[3][7] He played his college basketball at New York University (NYU) in 1944–48. In 1945, as a 16-year-old freshman, Schayes helped NYU reach the NCAA final.[8] Schayes earned an aeronautical engineering degree, was an All-American in basketball and won the Haggerty Award in his final year.[2][8][9] His NYU coach, Howard Cann, said of him: ""He was in the gym practicing every spare minute. We had to chase him out.""[7] Schayes was drafted by both the New York Knicks in the 1948 BAA draft (1st round; 4th pick overall), and by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in the NBL draft.[10] The Blackhawks traded his rights to the Syracuse Nationals, who then offered him a contract worth $7,500 (worth $79,800 today), 50% more than the Knicks, influencing his decision to go to Syracuse.[9][11] Schayes played one season in the NBL and was named the league's Rookie of the Year.[12] The following season (1949–50), the Nationals moved to the newly formed National Basketball Association as part of the merger between the BAA and NBL. Although tall for his era at 6' 7"" (201 cm), Schayes was especially known for his deadly, high-arcing, outside set-shot. It arced so high that his teammates referred to it as ""Sputnik"".[13] Defenders who attempted to deny him the outside shot were confronted by his powerful drive to the basket.[14] These two offensive weapons served him well, even as the NBA was transitioning into a league of jump-shooters. Early in Schayes' career, he broke his right arm and played almost an entire season in a cast. Oddly, this injury became a seminal point in his development: he learned to shoot with his off-hand, making him especially difficult to guard. He was one of the best—and the last—to use a two-handed set-shot with feet planted on the floor, before the game changed to one-handed jump shots.[11][15] In the 1949–50 season, he was 6th in the league in assists, with 259.[10] He led the NBA in rebounding in 1950–51 (in which he also had 10 of the top 14 individual rebounding games), with 1,080 and a 16.4-per-game average.[16][16][17] He was third in the league in rebounding in 1952–53, with 920.[10] In 1953–54, his 12.3 rebounds per game were fourth-best in the NBA.[10] In 1954–55, he led his team to the NBA championship.[10] In 1956–57, he led the league in minutes-per-game (39.6) and free throws (625), while grabbing 1,008 rebounds (3rd in the league) and averaging 22.6 points per game (4th in the league). In 1957, he set an NBA consecutive free throw record in a single game with 18.[18] In 1957–58 he again led the league in minutes-per-game (40.5), and averaged a career-high 24.9 points per game, second in the league, while averaging 14.2 rebounds per game (fourth in the NBA).[1][10] Schayes led the NBA in free throw percentage three times: in 1958 (.904), 1960 (.892) and 1962 (.896).[16][17][19] In 1959, he scored a career-high 50 points in a game against the Celtics.[18] In the NBA, he didn't miss a single game from February 17, 1952 to December 26, 1961, an NBA-record streak of 706 games.[18] In 1960–61, he again led the league in free throws (with 680).[10] In 1961, he became the first player in NBA history to amass 30,000 career total PRA (Points + Rebounds + Assists). He was the first person in the NBA to ever surpass 15,000 points.[8] A 12-time NBA All-Star, Schayes was a six-time All-NBA First Team honoree, and was also selected to the All-NBA Second Team six times.[19] He came in second in MVP voting in 1958, and 5th in both 1956 and 1957.[15] When he retired in 1964, he held the NBA records for games played (996), foul shots made (6,712), attempted (7,904), personal fouls (3,432) and was second to Bob Pettit in scoring (18,438) and third in rebounds (11,256).[citation needed] In 1970, he was elected to the NBA 25th Anniversary Team as one of the top 12 retired players.[15] In 1972, he was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[2] He is also a member of the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, the US National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, and the National Jewish American Sports Hall of Fame.[20] In 1996, he was selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.[21] The 76ers retired his jersey on March 12, 2016 while the Syracuse Crunch retired it on March 26, 2016.[22][23] When the Nationals moved to Philadelphia in 1963, Schayes was named player-coach of the Philadelphia 76ers. He retired as a player after the season, but stayed on as coach for three more seasons. He was named NBA Coach of the Year in 1966.[16] From 1966 to 1970, he was the supervisor of NBA referees.[2][21] He was named the first coach of the Buffalo Braves in 1970, but was fired one game into his second season.[8] Schayes coached the US Maccabiah Games basketball team to an upset win to take the gold medal in the 1977 Maccabiah Games.[2][21][24][25] He also coached the U.S. Masters basketball team at the 1993 Maccabiah Games.[26] He also played an active role raising money for the Maccabiah Games.[21][25] Schayes settled in Syracuse, New York in 1948, where he first played in the NBA, and where he was a real estate developer after his playing days.[27] Schayes' son is retired NBA center Danny Schayes, who played for Jamesville-DeWitt High School, in DeWitt, New York; Syracuse University; and in the NBA for 18 seasons.[2][7] His granddaughters Abi, Carla, and Rachel Goettsch won silver medals for the United States volleyball team at the 2001 Maccabiah Games, and his grandson Mickey Ferri won a gold medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay at the 2005 Maccabiah Games.[26][28] In May 2015, Schayes was inducted into the Bronx Walk of Fame, where he received a street named in his honor, called ""Dolph Schayes Street"".[29] Schayes died of cancer on December 10, 2015, at the age of 87.[8][30]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/264.png

Schultz was the second of three children to Leo and Minnie Schultz, raised in St. Paul, Minnesota alongside older brother Louis and younger sister Lorraine. Leo Schultz worked for Montgomery Ward for thirty-five years. His family lived three blocks north from Lexington Park, home of the St. Paul Saints of the American Association. Leo Schultz was a member of the St. Paul Municipal Baseball Board and Howie attended many Saints games as a youth with his father.[2] In 1940, Howie Schultz graduated from Central High School in St. Paul, Minnesota. Schultz attended Hamline University near his home in St. Paul. As a sophomore, Schultz lead Hamline to the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball (NAIB) championship.[3][2] While in college at Hamline, Schultz played minor league baseball. In 1940, Lou McKenna, the general manager of the Saints, recruited Schultz to play in the Class C Northern League after his freshman first year at Hamline. Schultz signed and then played for the Grand Forks (North Dakota) Chiefs in 1941.[2] Due to his height, 6-foot-6-inch (1.98 m), Schultz was deferred from serving in the armed forces during World War II.[4] Schultz began his professional career in baseball with the minor league Grand Forks Chiefs in 1941 and 1942.[5] Schultz then was promoted to the St. Paul Saints in 1942, where he was noticed by Branch Rickey general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. In 1943, Brooklyn called up Schultz from St. Paul.[2] From 1943 to 1948, Schultz, played Major League Baseball as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers (1943-1947), Philadelphia Phillies (1947-1948), and Cincinnati Reds (1948). He primarily played as a first baseman and was traded by Brooklyn to make room for Jackie Robinson.[5] Schultz had a career batting average of .241 with 24 home runs and 208 RBI in 470 career MLB games.[5] In the baseball off-season, Schultz played professional basketball. Schultz first played for the Anderson Packers of the NBL in 1946. When the Packers moved to the NBA in 1949-1950, Schultz served as their player-coach (21-14), before being traded to the Fort Wayne Pistons during the season.[6][3] Schultz later played two seasons with Minneapolis Lakers, winning an NBA championship in 1952, alongside teammates George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Vern Mikkelsen and Slater Martin.[7] In the championship against the New York Knicks, Schultz reportedly threw a punch at 6'3"" Knick player Ernie Vandeweghe in game 4 of the NBA Championship series. Schultz was ejected after receiving a Technical Foul and received a 50 dollar fine.[8] Schultz averaged 9.7 points per game in the NBL, and 5.3 in the NBA.[9] Schultz is one of 13 athletes who played in both the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball.

He last coached the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). As a player, he won three NBA championships with the Lakers during their Showtime era in the 1980s. Scott grew up in Inglewood, California, and played at Morningside High School, in the shadow of what was then the Lakers' home arena, The Forum. He played college basketball at Arizona State University for three years, then left after his junior year to play in the NBA. Selected by the San Diego Clippers in the first round, with the fourth pick of the 1983 NBA draft, Scott was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983 in exchange for Norm Nixon. During his playing career, Scott suited up for the Lakers, Indiana Pacers and Vancouver Grizzlies. Scott was a key player for the Lakers during the Showtime era, being a starter alongside Magic Johnson, James Worthy, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and A. C. Green. He played for the Lakers for 10 consecutive seasons (1983–1993). During that time he was on three NBA championship teams (1985, 1987, 1988). As a rookie, Scott was a member of the 1984 all-rookie team, averaging 10.6 PPG in 22 MPG. He led the NBA in three-point field goal percentage (.433) in 1984–85. In 1987–88, Scott enjoyed his best season, leading the NBA champion Lakers in scoring, averaging a career-best 21.7 ppg, and in steals (1.91 spg). He was the Lakers' starting shooting guard from 1984 until 1993. In 1996–97, the last year of Scott's playing career in the NBA, he went back to the Lakers and proved to be a valuable mentor for a team featuring Shaquille O'Neal, Eddie Jones, Nick Van Exel and 18-year-old rookie Kobe Bryant (Scott would be Bryant's coach on the Lakers towards the end of the latter's career). In the summer of 1997, Scott signed with the Greek Basket League team Panathinaikos for the 1997–98 season. That season, he played with Panathinaikos in both the FIBA Saporta Cup (known then as the FIBA EuroCup), Europe's second-tier level competition after the top-tier EuroLeague, and the Greek Basket League. In the Saporta Cup's 1997–98 season, he averaged 13.4 points, 2.4 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.1 steals, in 25.6 minutes per game, in 17 games played.[1] Scott helped to lead his team to the Greek Basket League championship with his scoring in many crucial games. In the Greek Basket League's 1997–98 season, he averaged 17.6 points, 2.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.3 steals per game, in 33.7 minutes per game, in 34 games played.[2] After one season with the Greek Basket League champions, Scott retired from playing professional basketball, and began his coaching career. Scott began his NBA coaching career in 1998, when he began the first of two seasons as an assistant with the Sacramento Kings. He specialized in teaching perimeter shooting during his tenure with the Kings and helped to lead the team to an excellent three-point shooting percentage during a pair of playoff seasons. In 2000, Scott took over a struggling New Jersey Nets team. His team performed poorly in his first year, but that changed in the 2001–02 season with the arrival of Jason Kidd as the Nets raced to a franchise record of 52 wins. In the process, they won their first Atlantic division crown and appeared in their first NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite losing the championship series to LA, Scott came back to coach the team through another successful season during the 2002–03 campaign, once again taking the team to the NBA Finals, but losing once again—this time to the San Antonio Spurs. New Jersey was up by double figures in game six, but the Spurs tightened up their defense, which won the game and the championship. Scott was fired during the 2003–04 season, as New Jersey had a disappointing 22–20 record coming into the All-Star break, even though they were leading their division at the time of his dismissal. Rumors of a rift between Scott and Kidd circulated media outlets, with sources allegedly claiming that Kidd wanted Scott out of Jersey. All the parties, including then Nets GM Rod Thorn, denied the reports. Scott claimed that he was ""very surprised"" by the report and that he and Kidd ""always got along"".[3] He was succeeded by his assistant Lawrence Frank. While coaching the Nets, Scott lived in Livingston, New Jersey.[4] Scott became the head coach of the New Orleans Hornets in 2004. Chris Paul was drafted by the team in 2005, and was named Rookie of the Year. In the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons, he guided the team to a pair of sub .500 seasons. One obstacle was that the team played most of its home games in Oklahoma City due to Hurricane Katrina's devastation of New Orleans. In the 2007–08 season, Scott had his first winning season as the Hornets head coach. They had a winning percentage of .683 with a record of 56–26. They became Southwest Division champions and finished 2nd overall in the Western Conference. Scott was named the head coach of the 2008 Western Conference All-Star team, and a few months after, he was awarded the 2007–2008 NBA coach of the year award. Due to his success, the Hornets awarded Scott with a two-year extension. The Hornets had a 30–11 home record and a 26–15 road record and clinched the second seed in the Western Conference Playoffs. The Hornets won their first round series against the Dallas Mavericks, posting a 4–1 record for the series. They would go on to face the defending champion San Antonio Spurs in the conference semifinals. An unusual trend of home court blow outs would mark the series until the deciding game 7 when the veteran Spurs would pull out a 91–82 win on the Hornets rowdy home court. The win marked the 100th playoff victory for Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. In the 2008–09 season, the Hornets finished 49–33 and entered the playoffs as a seventh seed. They faced the Denver Nuggets in the first round, losing after five brutal games, including 21- and 29-point blowouts, as well as a 58-point loss in game 4, which tied the worst margin of defeat in NBA postseason history.[5][6] Scott was relieved from his head coaching duties for the Hornets on November 12, 2009, following a 3–6 start.[7] He was mentioned as a candidate for several NBA coaching jobs, including the Chicago Bulls. Following his dismissal, he briefly served as a studio analyst for the NBA on ESPN. On July 2, 2010, Scott was named head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, a few days before the team lost star LeBron James to the Miami Heat.[8][9] During Scott's first season at the helm of the Cavs, he watched his team endure a 26-game losing streak, which was then the longest such streak in NBA history. Scott was reunited with Baron Davis (whom he coached with the Hornets) when a midseason trade brought Davis to Cleveland, and helped the Cavaliers close the season with several victories,[10] including a 102–90 upset victory over LeBron James and the Miami Heat,[11] which ensured that Cleveland did not have the worst record in the league at the season's end.[12] Cleveland used their first overall pick to draft Kyrie Irving, who became the second point guard Scott coached to the Rookie of the Year award. His second season in Cleveland saw them show some improvement in a shortened 66-game schedule. On April 18, 2013, Scott was fired by Cleveland Cavaliers management.[13] Though the Cavaliers ranked in the bottom five of the league in defensive efficiency in each of his three seasons,[14] analysts were surprised at the firing given the team's young and oft-injured rosters.[15] Irving and other Cavaliers players expressed their disappointment with the firing.[16] Scott spent the 2013–14 season as a Lakers television analyst on Time Warner Cable SportsNet.[17] After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's resignation.[18] On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers.[19] With the team rebuilding in 2014–15, Scott finished his first season as coach of the Lakers with a 21–61 record. In the 2015 NBA draft, the Lakers selected Ohio State point guard D'Angelo Russell with the second overall pick. The Lakers finished a franchise-worst 17–65 in 2015–16, Kobe Bryant's final season before retiring. It was the fifth straight season in Scott's coaching career that his team finished last in their division. On April 24, 2016, the Lakers did not exercise their option on Scott's contract for the following season, deciding to pursue a new coach.[20] His 38–126 (.232) record with the team was the worst of any of the 16 coaches who had led the franchise for at least two seasons.[21] Scott's non-profit organization, The Byron Scott Children's Fund, has raised more than $15 million over the past decade, with the proceeds going to various children's charities.[22] Scott has recently served as a studio analyst for ABC's NBA telecasts and was featured on ESPN. Scott and his ex-wife, Anita, have three children, Thomas, LonDen and DaRon.[23] In June 2013, Scott and Anita separated and in March 2014, he filed for divorce after 29 years of marriage due to irreconcilable differences.[24] Scott is currently a cast member on season 8 of VH1's ""Basketball Wives.""[citation needed]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/268.png

A 6'1"" guard, Seymour played collegiately at the University of Toledo, and had a 12-year career in the NBA and its predecessor, the Basketball Association of America (BAA). He played his first season for the Baltimore Bullets of the BAA; the remainder of his career was with the Syracuse Nationals. Seymour was named to the All-NBA second team in the 1954–55 and 1954–55 seasons and played in three NBA All-Star Games during his career. He won a championship with the Nationals in the 1954–55 season. For a good part of his career, Seymour was a player-coach for the Nats. Seymour still shares, with former teammate Red Rocha, the NBA record for most minutes in a playoff game with 67.[1] After finishing his playing career, Seymour continued a successful coaching career in the NBA, coaching three teams. Altogether he coached four teams in eight seasons. In 1961, he was the head coach of the Western Division Team in the All Star Game. Seymour was mentioned in the ESPN documentary, Black Magic, which told the story of African-Americans and basketball. In a segment about Cleo Hill, it was revealed that during the 1961–62 season, Bob Pettit and Cliff Hagan approached management and complained that Hill was taking too many shots. (Allegedly, this was just a cover-up for their desire to not play with an African-American teammate.) Management granted their wish, telling Seymour to severely diminish Hill's offensive role. Seymour refused and was fired 14 games into the season. While coaching at Baltimore during the 1965–1966 season, Seymour deliberately ended Johnny Kerr's then-record consecutive-games-played streak of 844 games by benching the team captain for one game. According to Kerr, only after the game did Seymour tell Kerr about his intention to end Kerr's streak, saying, ""This will take the pressure off you."" [2] Seymour was featured in the book, Basketball History in Syracuse, Hoops Roots by author Mark Allen Baker published by The History Press in 2010. The book is an introduction to professional basketball in Syracuse and includes teams like (Vic Hanson's) All-Americans, the Syracuse Reds and the Syracuse Nationals (1946–1963).

He is mostly known for his time with the Boston Celtics in the 1950s, partnering with Bob Cousy in what some consider the greatest backcourt duo of all time. As a coach, Sharman won titles in the ABL, ABA, and NBA, and is credited with introducing the now ubiquitous morning shootaround. He was the first North American sports figure to win a championship as a player, coach, and executive. He was a 10-time NBA champion (having won four titles as a player with the Celtics, one as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, and five as a Lakers executive), and a 12-time World Champion in basketball overall counting his ABL and ABA titles.[1] Sharman is also a two-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, having been being inducted in 1976 as a player, and in 2004 as a coach.[2] Only John Wooden, Lenny Wilkens and Tommy Heinsohn share this double honor. Sharman completed high school in the Central California city of Porterville, California. He served during World War II from 1944 to 1946 in the US Navy, and was a graduate of the University of Southern California. He played 1st base on the 1948 USC Trojans' College World Series championship team. Following his senior year, Sharman was selected as one of the 1950 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans. From 1950 to 1955 Sharman played professional baseball in the Brooklyn Dodgers minor league system. He was called up to the Dodgers late in the 1951 season but did not appear in a game. He was part of a September 27 game in which the entire Brooklyn bench was cleared from the dugout for arguing with the home plate umpire over a ruling at the plate. This has led to the legend that Sharman holds the distinction of being the only player in baseball history to have ever been ejected from a major league game without ever appearing in one. However, although Sharman was among the Dodger bench players that had to go to the clubhouse, none of them were actually barred from playing in the game. In fact, in the top of the ninth, one of the other dismissed players, Wayne Terwilliger, was used as a pinch-hitter in the game.[3] Sharman was drafted by the Washington Capitols in the 2nd round of the 1950 NBA draft. Following the disbanding of the Capitols, he was selected by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the dispersal draft and was subsequently traded to the Boston Celtics (with Bob Brannum) for Chuck Share prior to the 1951–52 season.[4] Sharman played a total of ten seasons for the Celtics, leading the team in scoring between the 1955–56 and 1958–59 seasons and averaging over 20 points per game during three of them.[5] Sharman was one of the first NBA guards to shoot better than .400 from the field. He led the NBA in free throw percentage a record seven times (including a record five consecutive seasons),[2] and his mark of 93.2% in the 1958–59 season remained the NBA record until Ernie DiGregorio topped it in 1976–77. Sharman still holds the record for consecutive free throws in the playoffs with 56.[1] Sharman was named to the All-NBA First Team from 1956 through 1959, and was an All-NBA Second Team member in 1953, 1955, and 1960.[4] Sharman played in eight NBA All-Star games, scoring in double figures in seven of them. He was named the 1955 NBA All-Star Game MVP after scoring ten of his fifteen points in the fourth quarter.[6] Sharman still holds the NBA All-Star Game record for field goals attempted in a quarter with 12. Sharman ended his NBA playing career after 11 seasons in 1961. Sharman coached the Cleveland Pipers of the American Basketball League to the league championship in 1962.[2] He next went on to coach Los Angeles State (now California State, Los Angeles) for two seasons. In 1970–71 he coached the Utah Stars to an ABA title and was a co-recipient of the ABA Coach of the Year honors. After resigning as coach for the Utah Stars, Sharman signed a contract to coach the Los Angeles Lakers. Controversy later ensued when the owner of the Utah Stars brought suit against Sharman for breach of contract stemming from his resignation, and a tort case against the owner of the Los Angeles Lakers for inducing such breach of contract. Sharman was originally ordered to pay $250,000 in damages, but later appealed the trial court decision and reversed the judgement. The following season, he guided the Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West-led Los Angeles Lakers to an NBA record 33 game win streak, a then-record 69-13 win-loss mark, the first Lakers championship in Los Angeles and the first for the team in more than a decade. That season, Sharman was named NBA Coach of the Year. He is one of two men to win NBA and ABA championships as a coach; coincidentally, the other, Alex Hannum, also coached a Chamberlain-led team (the 1967 Philadelphia 76ers) to an NBA championship. Sharman invented the morning shootaround as a way to burn off nervous energy on game days. He took the shootaround with him to his first coaching jobs in the ABL, the ABA, and later, the NBA. After the Lakers won the championship in 1972, every other team in the league added the shootaround to its game-day regimen.[2] Sharman was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1976 as a player and again in 2004 as a coach. He is one of only four people to be enshrined in both categories, the others being John Wooden, Lenny Wilkens and his former teammate Tom Heinsohn. In 1971, Sharman was named to the NBA 25th Anniversary Team. On October 29, 1996, Sharman was named one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players. As Lakers General Manager, Sharman built the 1980 and 1982 NBA Championship teams, and as Lakers President he oversaw the 1985, 1987 and 1988 NBA Championship teams. Sharman retired from the Lakers front office in 1991 at age 65.[1] Sharman was the author of two books, Sharman on Basketball Shooting and The Wooden-Sharman Method: A Guide to Winning Basketball with John Wooden and Bob Selzer. The gymnasium at Porterville High School is named after him. After his former basketball team the Los Angeles Jets dissolved in 1962, he sued to enforce his employment contract with the Jets, culminating in the case Sharman v. Longo (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 948. In 2013, Sharman decided to sell his 2010 NBA Championship ring that he received from the Lakers to benefit charity.[7] Sharman died at his home in Redondo Beach, California on October 25, 2013 at the age of 87, after having had a stroke the week prior.[8]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/272.png

He could play both guard positions, but was used primarily at point guard over the course of his 14 seasons in the league. Shaw grew up in Oakland, California with other future basketball stars such as Antonio Davis, Jason Kidd, and Gary Payton, as well as Demetrius ""Hook"" Mitchell.[2] In his youth, he was a participant at the East Oakland Youth Development Center, a local community organization where he played basketball. He attended Westlake Middle School and then Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland. For college, he attended St. Mary's College of California for his freshman and sophomore years of college, then transferred to UC Santa Barbara for his junior and senior seasons. In his senior year, he was named Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA) player of the year as he led the Gauchos to their first ever NCAA tournament berth. He was taken with the 24th overall pick by the Boston Celtics in the 1988 NBA draft. In 1988, Shaw signed a one-year contract with the Celtics. In 1989, Shaw signed a two-year contract to play with an Italian team, Il Messaggero Roma. At the end of January 1990, Shaw signed a 5-year deal with the Celtics. In June of that year, Shaw told the Celtics he planned to play for Il Messaggero during the 1990 season. The ensuing contract dispute, Boston Celtics v. Brian Shaw,[3] which Shaw lost,[4] became a relatively famous sports law case and is read in many law school contracts classes.[citation needed] During his NBA career, he played for the Celtics, Miami Heat, Orlando Magic, Golden State Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers, Portland Trail Blazers, and Los Angeles Lakers. He was a member of four squads that made NBA Finals appearances: the 1995 Magic and the 2000, 2001, and 2002 Lakers (with the Laker teams all winning championships). He also played for the US national team in the 1986 FIBA World Championship, winning the gold medal.[5] In the final between the US and Soviet Union, Shaw hit a key three-pointer in the closing seconds. The American team won the game by two points. Shaw joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 1999, re-uniting with former Orlando teammate Shaquille O'Neal. He served as a backup to All-Star shooting guard Kobe Bryant throughout the season and playoffs as the Lakers had the league's best record winning 67 games. Shaw played in all 22 of the Lakers' playoff games as they advanced past the Sacramento Kings and the Phoenix Suns before facing the Portland Trail Blazers in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers took a 3–1 lead in the series before the Trail Blazers won games 5 and 6 to tie the series at three games apiece. In game 7, the Trail Blazers took a 71–58 lead into the fourth quarter. The Blazers shot 5 for 23 in the final quarter as the Lakers made a comeback bolstered by two clutch three-point baskets by Shaw. The Lakers won the game and made the NBA Finals to face the Indiana Pacers. Shaw started in game 3 in place of the injured Bryant, and then played critical minutes in the Lakers overtime win in game 4. The Lakers won the series 4–2, and Shaw won his first NBA championship. Shaw continued to back up Bryant in the 2001 season, but started a total of 28 games. He once again played a key role for the Lakers as they steamrolled through the playoffs and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 4 games to 1 in the 2001 NBA Finals. The Lakers won a third title in the 2001–2002 season before losing in the Western Conference Semifinals to the San Antonio Spurs in the 2002–2003 season. Shaw retired following the 2003 season. While a member of the Heat, on April 8, 1993, Shaw hit a then-NBA record ten three-point field goals (out of 15 attempts) against the Milwaukee Bucks at the Bradley Center, finishing with 32 points. Starting in 1994, he was one-half of the popular ""Shaw-Shaq Redemption"" (named after The Shawshank Redemption), an alley-oop from Shaw to Shaquille O'Neal that was popular with fans in both Orlando and Los Angeles (Shaw and O'Neal were also Laker teammates). In an interview with The Miami Herald in 2007, O'Neal claimed that the teammate he had most respected in his career was Shaw.[6] On NBA All-Star Weekend in 2000, held in Oakland, Shaw received a key to the City of Oakland along with his fellow Oakland natives Jason Kidd and Gary Payton. Shaw retired following the 2002–03 season. He worked for the Lakers as an Oakland-based scout during the 2003–04 season. He was appointed assistant coach of the Lakers during the 2004–05 season. He was considered for the Lakers head coaching job following Phil Jackson's retirement, but was ultimately passed over in favor of Mike Brown. Shaw left the Lakers to join the Indiana Pacers as an assistant coach. He was later promoted to associate head coach. Shaw was a highly respected assistant coach by other NBA coaches as well as the media.[7] After spending two years on the Pacers' bench, on June 25, 2013, Shaw was announced as the head coach of the Denver Nuggets, replacing former coach George Karl.[8] On March 3, 2015, he was fired by the Nuggets after compiling a record of 56–85 (.397) in just under two seasons.[9] In June 2016, Shaw returned to the Los Angeles Lakers as the team's newest associate head coach under new head coach Luke Walton's coaching staff. On June 26, 1993, both of Shaw's parents and his sister were killed in an auto accident in Nevada.[10] His sister's daughter survived the crash and Shaw, with help from his aunt, helped raise her.[11] Shaw's wife, Nikki, is a professional chef.[12] They married in 1998 and have three children.[13] Media related to Brian Shaw at Wikimedia Commons",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/273.png

Shue was one of the top guards of the early days of the NBA and an influential figure in the development of basketball. He is credited with inventing the ""Spin Move"" while being an early harbinger of other plays and strategies. Shue was an NBA All-Star five consecutive times (1958–62). After his successful playing career, he became a long-serving coach, twice winning NBA Coach of the Year. Throughout his career as player, coach, and executive, Shue was ""a specialist at taking over faltering teams.""[1] Shue grew up Baltimore, Maryland's Govans neighborhood and attended Towson Catholic High School.[2] His family lived on welfare and he did not own a basketball as a child.[3] He grew up a fan of the Baltimore Bullets and Buddy Jeannette, recollecting in 1994: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} As a prospect in 1950, Shue was lightly recruited by University of Maryland's newly hired coach Bud Millikan. However, he wanted to play for the more-established programs at Loyola or Georgetown. After getting turned down by Loyola and getting wait listed by Georgetown after two underwhelming tryouts, Shue opted to instead play for Maryland.[5] Shue did not receive a scholarship and instead worked odds jobs, including cleaning the basketball court (only receiving a scholarship his senior season).[5] Joining a program with Coach Millikan that had losing records in eight of its last 10 seasons, Shue later remarked:In his tenure with Maryland, he and Milikan led the school's team to new heights, including their first 20-plus win regular season (23 his senior year), their first appearance in national rankings (peaked at #13 in 1954), and entrance into the Atlantic Coast Conference.[7] He left Maryland as its star player[8] and their first high-profile NBA prospect. He broke all of the school scoring records and made the All-ACC team.[9] After graduation, he was drafted 3rd overall in the 1954 NBA draft by the Philadelphia Warriors. After just six games with the Warriors Shue was sold to the New York Knicks,[10] after notifying then-owner Eddie Gottlieb that his paycheck was $10 short.[11] After the 1955–56 season Shue was traded to the Fort Wayne Pistons for Ron Sobie. In 1956–57 season he played his first season (third season in the league) for the Pistons. The franchise moved to Detroit the following season. Shue recalled the struggles during the opening game at the Olympia. ""There were so many delays during the game because the floor was slippery from the ice below it, a problem that often happened. I didn’t like playing there because it was a large building with small crowds and you were always freezing your butt off.""[12] In Detroit, Shue blossomed as a player and became popular enough for the P.A. to develop the catchphrase ""Two for Shue.""[13] He started a streak of five All-Star Game appearances and five playoff berths. In 1959–60 season he recorded 22.8 pts/game (6th-most in the NBA) (1,712 pts) and 5.5 rebounds/game, leading the NBA in minutes (3,338) and finishing second in free throw percentage (.872) while earning All-NBA First Team honors. He played 11 complete games during a season and tied the league with 3,338 minutes played.[13] The following year, he may have had his most complete year ever, averaging 4.3 rebounds/game, 6.8 assists/game (4th in the NBA) (530 assists also 4th) and 22.6 points/game (10th-most in the NBA) (1,765 pts). He also marked his highest field goal percentage (.421) and was named to the All-NBA Second Team. The 1961–62 season was his last one as star player; he averaged 19.0 pts/game and 5.8 assists/game (5th in the NBA) (465 assists also 5th). In 1962, Shue was traded back to the New York Knicks for Darrall Imhoff and cash.[13][14] In 1963, Shue was traded along with Paul Hogue to the Baltimore Bullets for Bill McGill. As Shue moved on from playing, Shue would start an NBA coaching career that would last over 22 years. He developed a reputation for helping bad teams become competitive.[9] In 1986, LA Times remarked, ""Gene Shue has lost more games than any coach in National Basketball Assn. history, which is more of a testimony of Shue's coaching ability than a criticism. Anybody who can lose 768 games—he has won 757—and still be employed must be a good coach.""[15] In his first stint, the then 35-year-old led the Baltimore Bullets took over a 4-21 team mid-season leading them to a dismal 16–40 record. Two seasons later, he led the franchise the best record in the league, also the franchise's first winning season.[16] He oversaw the team's improvement with three 50-plus-win seasons and an Eastern Conference Championship in 1970–71.[17] He guided the Bullets to the NBA Finals in 1971 but got swept by the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar/Oscar Robertson-led Milwaukee Bucks. He famously took over the Philadelphia 76ers after a season with a then-record 73 losses.[18] Under his tenure, the team increased their total from 25 games, then 34, then 46, and 50 with an Eastern Conference Championship. For the 76ers' 50-win 1976–77 season, Shue led a talented team with raised expectations, that Turquoise Erving (wife of Julius Erving) would lament in March 1977, ""I feel we have the talent to win, but I don't think they're playing much like a team. No one here respects Shue. How many guys want to win one for Shue? Not one. And sometimes not even for themselves.""[19] Although reaching the Finals, they eventually lost to the Bill Walton-led Portland Trail Blazers in the NBA Finals, a devastating loss as Shue had spent much of the season dealing with in-fighting among the team's many stars.[20] Shue was fired six games into the next 1977–78 season, having clashed with new owner Fitz Dixon[21] despite raising the expectations to a championship.[17] The team went as far to start an ""We Owe You One' advertising campaign in reaction to the loss.[20][22] In the next season, Shue joined the newly relocated San Diego Clippers and surprised the league with a 43–39 record and a near-playoff berth.[23] He was fired the next season after an 11-game losing streak.[24] In 1987, he returned to Bullets,[25] who had since re-located to Washington, D.C., where he would coach for six seasons.[15] He would end his coaching career by returning to Clippers, who had once again relocated to Los Angeles. Shue finished his coaching career with a regular season record of 784–861 while going 30–47 in the playoffs.[26] His 784 wins are the 16th-most in NBA history and his 861 losses are the sixth-most in NBA history.[27] He won NBA Coach of the Year in both 1968 and 1981, one of nine multi-time recipients. He was the Eastern Conference Coach for two All-Star Games, in 1969 and 1977. After his final coaching position, Shue opted to move to California to become vice president of a mortgage business and work for a bank, while also serving as an analyst for ESPN on Continental Basketball Association games.[28] He would soon be chosen as the GM for the 76ers.[29][30] He was infamously the target of Charles Barkley, who called Shue ""a clown"" as part of Barkley's effort to force a trade out of the team,[31] and rumored tampering from executives from other teams.[32] In 2009, Shue was stated to be living in Marina del Rey, California and serving as a scout for the 76ers.[33] Shue's dynamic guard play was influential for the newly formed NBA. He was known as a ""gunner"" who also played superb defense.[13] His flair for dribbling and weaving was not the norm of the time, but would later become so for point guards.[34] He had an ability to drive to the basket and use acrobatics to score or pass.[35] His twisting layup wowed competitors, Elgin Baylor describing it as ""tricky"" [36] He was one of the few players of his time to have a jump shot instead of a set shot (a habit from his grammar school's low ceiling)[37], and to emphasize transitional offense.[1] He invented the ""spin move"", the 360-degree spin with the ball switching hands.[37] An advocate for skill-based play, he once posited that ""a basketball team composed of little men up to 6 feet 5 inches could beat a team of tall men 6 feet 5 inches and over.""[38] Throughout his coaching career, Shue was known for his mix of fundamental basketball and unconventional strategies, many of which went against the norms of the time, but were sometimes adopted in future generations. His infamous playbooks were both celebrated for their innovation and maligned for their heftiness.[39][40][41][42] In 1988, Gerald Henderson declared, ""Gene Shue's teams always control the tempo.""[43] NBA.com stated that Shue was one of the only coaches that embraced and set plays for the then-controversial three-point shots when the line was first introduced, stating that Shue ""gave the shot the green light and red carpet.""[44] At times, he had his team's center bring up the ball.[45] George McGinnis describing the merits of Shue's coaching philosophy, said, ""He has a lot of plays that use my individual talent and a lot of plays for the team.""[46] Earl Monroe noted Shue's ability to get star players, like Monroe himself, to adapt their flashy skills to sound, fundamental team play (noting the perceived racial segregation in styles of play of the time).[47] Spencer Haywood described Shue's ability to instill confidence ""My guy was Gene Shue, and still is Gene Shue, who had the faith in me to say, ""Take this team, and let's go."" [48] Bill Walton wrote in his autobiography that Shue ""was awesome, always so positive, upbeat, imaginative, and extremely creative.""[49] In 1980, Sports Illustrated suggested that Shue ""might be the reigning expert on the rehabilitation of players, judging from his penchant for taking in the league's rejects and wayward souls.""[50] In 2009, Fox Sports listed him as one of ten great players who became great coaches, noting that Shue ""specialized in improving the fortunes of bad ball clubs, which is the only reason why he lost so many games.""[51] Although his lifelong tendency to seek out challenging situations to turnaround has resulted in less wins, trophies, and accolades as both a player and a coach; in 1987, he remarked, ""I think when you come into any losing situation, the first thing you have to bring with you is a positive attitude, one that your players can begin to believe in. Not that I ignore problems. I'm both optimistic and realistic. I have always been honest. I don't try to kid people.""[52] In 1989, the LA Times stated, ""Gene Shue has proven to be one of the best coaches the NBA has ever had.""[53] In 1991, he was inducted to University of Maryland's Hall of Fame.[54] Shue's was first on a ballot as a coach for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1994, but was not elected. He was nominated and failed in 1995.[55] He was re-introduced in the Contributor category, where he was nominated, but not inducted, in 2011,[56]2012[57], and 2013 [58], His career includes over 40 years in the NBA, although split as player, coach, and executive.[4] Bleacher Report listed him first on their list of coaches not in the Hall of Fame, but factored his playing career).[59] Shue is one of two retired coaches (alongside Cotton Fitzsimmons) to have NBA Coach of the Year on multiple occasions but not be elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.[60] Gene Shue is married to Sandy Shue. In 1985, when asked about the effect of basketball on home life, Sandy Shue remarked, ""People think he's got the most violent temper. They say, 'He must be an absolute bear to live with.' When we first began dating I really didn't like it. If he lost a basketball game he wouldn't speak to anyone, even me. Now he pretends like things are okay, but he still stays awake all night.""[61] As of 2009, they live together in Marina Del Rey, California. He is the godfather of Danny Ferry[62][63], who would similarly become an NBA Player and Executive.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/275.png
276,Paul Silas,"July 12, 1943",,"McClymonds in Oakland, California",Creighton,1981,2012,12,true,,"""[1, 4, 1, 6]""",/coaches/silaspa01c.html,"Paul Theron Silas (born July 12, 1943) is an American retired professional basketball player and former NBA head coach. Born in Prescott, Arkansas,[1] Silas attended Creighton University, where he set an NCAA record for the most rebounds in three seasons and averaged 20.6 rebounds per game in 1963. In the NBA, Silas collected more than 10,000 points and 10,000 rebounds during his sixteen-year career, played in two All-Star games, and won three championship rings (two with the Boston Celtics in 1974 and 1976, and one with the Seattle SuperSonics in 1979). He was named to the All-NBA Defensive First Team twice, and to the All-NBA Defensive Second Team three times. Immediately upon retirement, Silas started his coaching career with the San Diego Clippers from 1980-83, becoming their head coach, compiling a 78-168 record for a team that struggled with injuries to stars including Bill Walton. After taking time off, Silas was an assistant coach for the New Jersey Nets for one season from 1988-89, and then became an assistant coach with the New York Knicks from 1989-92 as one of the holdovers from the Stu Jackson and John Macleod eras. Silas then went back to work for the Nets as an assistant under Chuck Daly and later Butch Beard from 1992-95, leaving to work with the Suns from 1995-97. At one point, Silas was one of the names considered for the head coaching job of the Boston Celtics in the Summer of 1995 before General Manager M.L. Carr decided to name himself as coach of the team.[2] After joining the coaching staff of the Charlotte Hornets in 1997, Silas was finally given another chance as a coach after becoming the interim coach of the Hornets when Dave Cowens was fired after a 4-11 record. Under Silas, the Hornets turned it around and went 22-13 to finish the lockout-shortened season 26-24, missing the playoffs by one game. Silas had the interim tag lifted off of his status and became the full-time head coach of the Hornets from 1999 all the way into their first season where they moved to New Orleans. Coaching the team from 1999-2003, Silas had a 208-155 record, taking the team into the playoffs each season he was the head coach after that 1999 season, including two Eastern Conference Semifinals appearances. Silas had a reputation of being a coach who was very honest but fair with his criticism of his players, which they mostly appreciated.[3] Silas was fired as coach on May 4, 2003, in a move that puzzled lots of Hornets players (including Baron Davis) who enjoyed playing for him.[4] Silas was head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2003 to 2005. Hired to mentor LeBron James, his tenure was rife with controversy as he feuded with veteran point guard Eric Snow and new owner Dan Gilbert fired him in the middle of the season with the Cavaliers at 34-30 and fifth place in the Eastern Conference.[5] The Cavs would collapse after the firing of Silas and miss the playoffs that season due to a tiebreak with the New Jersey Nets. Silas then worked for ESPN, although in April 2007, he interviewed for the vacant head coaching position with the Charlotte Bobcats (later known as the Charlotte Hornets) which was eventually filled by Sam Vincent. Upon the firing of Vincent in April 2008, he stated that coaching the Bobcats would be a ""dream job.""[6] On December 22, 2010, Silas was named interim head coach of the Bobcats, replacing the outgoing coach Larry Brown.[7] On February 16, 2011, the Bobcats removed his interim status.[8] On April 30, 2012, the Bobcats announced that Silas would not return to the Bobcats for the 2012–2013 season after producing the worst record in NBA history.[9] Because of the record transfer that occurred in 2014, Silas' tenure with the Bobcats is now recognized as his second tenure with the Charlotte Hornets, meaning that he had coached them for about six seasons with a record of 204–220. Also due to the record transfer, Silas was the first head coach in the history of the New Orleans Hornets/Pelicans franchise.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/276.png
277,Scott Skiles,"March 5, 1964",,"Plymouth in Plymouth, Indiana",Michigan State,2000,2016,14,true,,"""[2, 5, 1, 2]""",/coaches/skilesc01c.html,"Scott Allen Skiles Sr. (born March 5, 1964) is an American basketball coach and former player. He most recently served as the head coach of the Orlando Magic. He also coached the Phoenix Suns, Chicago Bulls, and Milwaukee Bucks. A first-round draft pick out of Michigan State University, Skiles played ten seasons as a point guard in the NBA. He holds the NBA record for assists in one game with 30, set in his fifth season in the league and second with Orlando, in which he also earned the 1990–91 NBA Most Improved Player Award. In 1982, Skiles led Plymouth High School to the Indiana State Championship, scoring 39 points to lead the Pilgrims past the Gary Roosevelt Panthers in double overtime. During the 1982 season Skiles led the state in scoring, averaging 30.2 points per game. He set several records[clarification needed] during high school, including most points in a home game (53) and most points in an away game (56). He left Plymouth as the school's all-time career scoring leader (1,788 points), a record that would stand until 2005. Skiles had his number 22 jersey retired at Plymouth High School in 1992. Skiles attended Michigan State University, where in his senior season he was a First Team All-America selection as well as the Big Ten Conference MVP and scoring champion. He left MSU as its all-time career scoring leader (2,145 points) and still holds the Spartans' record for most points scored in a season (850). While in East Lansing, he was arrested and charged with felony possession of cocaine and misdemeanor possession of marijuana. The cocaine charge was dropped, and Skiles pleaded guilty to the marijuana possession. He was arrested and charged with drunken driving a year later and served 15 days in jail. During his senior season, Skiles committed a parole violation on an earlier marijuana conviction, and served a brief jail sentence.[1] The Milwaukee Bucks made Skiles the 22nd selection of the 1986 NBA draft. In ten seasons, he played for the Bucks (1986–87), Indiana Pacers (1987–89), Orlando Magic (1989–94), Washington Bullets (1994–95), and Philadelphia 76ers (1995–96). Skiles was little used his rookie season with the Bucks, averaging 3.8 points and 3.5 assists in just 13 games off the bench. With the Indiana Pacers the next season Skiles averaged even fewer minutes but played in more games, increasing his scoring marginally to 4.4 points and posting the same 3.5 assists per game in 50 games, just two of them starts. He played in 80 games in 1988–89, starting just 13 and averaging 6.8 points and 4.9 assists in slightly under 20 minutes a game. In 1989 Skiles was selected by the newly formed Orlando Magic in the NBA expansion draft. Mainly a backup point guard, he scored 7.7 points and posted 4.8 assists in 20.9 minutes per game in 70 games, 48 off the bench. In 1990–91 he transitioned to a starting role at the position, jumping to a career high 17.2 points and improved 8.4 assists in 34.4 minutes over 79 games and 66 starts. The season was highlighted on December 30, 1990, when Skiles racked up 30 assists in Orlando's 155-116 victory over the Denver Nuggets at Orlando Arena, breaking Kevin Porter's NBA single-game assists record (29).[2] His well more than doubling scoring and nearly doubling his assists marks from the previous year earned him the NBA Most Improved Player Award. The next year, 1991–92, was a bit of a backslide, dropping to 14.1 points and 7.3 assists in 31.7 minutes in 75 games, with games started, field goals made, field goal percentage, 2-pointers made, 2-point percentage, 3-pointers made, 3-point percentage, free throws, free throw percentage, offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, total rebounds, and steals all falling off. 1992–93 saw a bouncing back nearly across the board, with scoring up to 15.4 points, a career high 9.4 assists, and career highs in shooting percentage and 2-point shooting percentage in a career high 39.6 minutes in 78 games, all starts. Skiles played in all 82 games in 1993–94 but only started 46, showing severe drop-offs in minutes, field goals, field goal percentage, 2-pointers made, 2-point percentage, rebounds, assists, and scoring, posting just 9.9 points and 6.1 assists per game. Skiles began the year as a starter but in the second half of the season he became a reserve, leaving Anfernee Hardaway as his successor. Skiles was traded to the Washington Bullets in the offseason to create salary cap space. As a Washington Bullets in 1994–95 Skiles' minutes were back up to 33.5 per game in just 62 games, all starts, and improvements were shown in virtually every statistical category, though points per game only rose to 13.0 and assists to 7.3. Skiles spent only a single season in Washington, moving on to the Philadelphia 76ers in his final NBA season in 1995–96. Appearing in only 10 games Skiles stats backslid again, with only 6.3 points and 3.8 assists in 23.6 minutes per game over 9 starts. Nursing a serious shoulder injury in 1996, Skiles left the U.S. for the Greek League, joining PAOK in Thessaloniki. Expectations were high for the new arrival from the NBA, but midway through the season injuries and contract problems with key players threatened the season for both PAOK and French coach Michel Gomez. Still struggling with injury himself, and increasingly at odds with Gomez, Skiles asked to be released from his contract. Instead, president Lakis Alexopoulos fired Gomez and offered Skiles the job. Despite lacking three of their top players due to injury, Skiles led PAOK to a winning record as coach in the remainder of the '96-'97 season, and an unexpected 3rd-place finish in the Greek League, thus assuring a qualification to the following year's Euroleague. Skiles returned to the NBA for the 1997–98 season as an assistant coach with the Phoenix Suns, being elevated to head coach in 1999. Under Skiles Phoenix compiled a .595 Won-Loss record and made the playoffs in two of his three years as head coach, including a first-round win over the defending NBA champion San Antonio Spurs in 2000. After a two-year absence from the game, Skiles came to the Chicago Bulls as head coach in 2003. He immediately focused on improving the young Bulls' defense and developing greater consistency in a talented but underachieving team. In the first full year under his direction, Chicago limited its opposition to an NBA-best .422 field goal percentage and held their opponents to a franchise record and league high 26 straight games below 100 points. An NBA best 13-3 mark in January 2005 earned Skiles the NBA Eastern Conference Coach of the Month honor. The 2006 Bulls went 41–41 record, earning a 7th seed in the playoffs falling to 2nd seeded Miami Heat in six games. In 2007 the Bulls improved to a 49-33 and again faced the Heat in the first round of the post-season, this time sweeping them in four games. They lost the first three games of the second-round against the top-seeded Detroit Pistons, dropping the last at the United Center after holding a double-digit lead for much of the game. After a two-game rally they were eliminated in six. The Bulls had high expectations heading into the 2007–08 season. Mired in last place in the Central Division 25 games in, they were 9–16 when Skiles was fired by general manager John Paxson on December 24, 2007.[3] On April 21, 2008, the Milwaukee Bucks signed their former player Skiles as team's new head coach.[4] He led the Bucks to a 34–48 record in the 2008–09 season. Injuries to key players Michael Redd and Andrew Bogut marred the season, but Skiles was given a show of support by general manager John Hammond.[citation needed] The next season Skiles had success with an improving, if still young, core led by Bogut at center and Brandon Jennings at point guard. Midseason trades for John Salmons and Jerry Stackhouse gave Skiles both a reliable shooter and a veteran presence on the Bucks' bench. Most NBA prognosticators picked the Bucks to finish last in the Eastern Conference, but the team's defense helped the Bucks beat several of the top teams in the NBA. After a gruesome injury to Bogut's right arm on April 3, 2010, Skiles coached his team to a decisive victory over the heavily favored Phoenix Suns. Three days later Skiles and the Bucks clinched a playoff berth by beating the Chicago Bulls in Chicago. They finished the regular season with a 46–36 mark, their first winning record in seven years. Skiles was frequently mentioned in NBA Coach of the Year talks, eventually finishing second to Oklahoma City Thunder head coach Scott Brooks.[5] Skiles' five-year stint in Milwaukee ended on January 8, 2013, when he and the Bucks mutually agreed to part ways.[6] On May 29, 2015, former team point guard Skiles joined the Orlando Magic as the franchise's 12th head coach.[7] On May 12, 2016, after head coaching the team for one season, Skiles stepped down as head coach of the Orlando Magic, claiming he was ""not the right head coach"" for the Magic.[8][9]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/277.png
278,Jerry Sloan,"March 28, 1942",,"McLeansboro in McLeansboro, Illinois",University of Evansville,1980,2011,26,true,,"""[5, 2]""",/coaches/sloanje01c.html,"Gerald Eugene Sloan (born March 28, 1942) is an American former National Basketball Association player and head coach, and a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame.[1] Former NBA commissioner David Stern called Sloan ""one of the greatest and most respected coaches in NBA history"".[2] Sloan had a career regular-season win–loss record of 1,223–803, placing him third all-time in NBA wins at the time he retired.[3] Sloan was only the fifth coach in NBA history to reach 1,000 victories and is one of two coaches in NBA history to record 1,000 wins with one club (the Utah Jazz). He also coached for one team longer than anyone in NBA history. The 2009–10 season was his 22nd season (and 21st full season) as coach of the Jazz. Sloan coached the Jazz to 15 consecutive playoff appearances from 1989 to 2003. Although he never won a Coach of the Year award, he is one of only four coaches in NBA history with 15-plus consecutive seasons with a winning record (Gregg Popovich, Pat Riley and Phil Jackson are the others).[3] He led Utah to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, but lost to the Chicago Bulls both times. After Tom Kelly stepped down as manager of the Minnesota Twins in Major League Baseball in 2001, Sloan became the longest-tenured head coach in American major league sports with their current franchise. He resigned on February 10, 2011. On June 19, 2013, the Utah Jazz announced that Sloan was returning as an adviser and scouting consultant.[4] Born and raised in Gobbler's Knob, 15 miles south of McLeansboro, Illinois,[5] Sloan was the youngest of 10 children and was raised by a single mother after his father died when Jerry was 4 years old. He would wake up at 4:30 a.m. to do farm chores and then walk almost two miles to get to school in time for 7 a.m. basketball practice. Sloan graduated an all-state player from McLeansboro High School in 1960.[6] Sloan played for the University of Evansville's basketball team and was selected 19th in the 1964 NBA draft by the Baltimore Bullets, sitting out the season, then was selected fourth in the 1965 NBA draft by the Bullets, which traded him after one season to the new Chicago Bulls, where he became ""the Original Bull"", known for his tenacious defense, leading them to the playoffs in their first season, and to their first and only division title before the Michael Jordan era; after a series of knee injuries, he retired in 1976. He scored more than 18 points a game in 1970–71, and had three other seasons of more than 15 points per game. At a height of 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m), his career rebounding average was 7.4 rebounds per game, with one season having an average of 9.1 rebounds. He was a career 72 percent free throw shooter.[7] His number 4 jersey was subsequently retired by the Chicago Bulls in 1978, becoming the first retired jersey in franchise history.[8] While at Evansville, coach McCutchan suggested that Sloan coach at his alma mater. After retiring in 1976, Sloan took the Evansville job, but withdrew after five days.[9] That same season, the Evansville basketball team and coaching staff were killed in a plane crash at Evansville Airport. Two years later, Sloan was hired by the Bulls as a scout.[10] After one season in this role, he became an assistant coach with the team. In 1979, Sloan was promoted to the position of head coach. He held the position for less than three seasons, winning 94 games and losing 121. He led the team to the playoffs in his second year, but was fired after a poor start during the following campaign. After departing Chicago, Sloan became a scout for the Utah Jazz for one season. He then became coach of the Evansville Thunder of the Continental Basketball Association for the 1984 season but never coached a game instead accepting an assistant coach position with the Jazz. After Frank Layden became team president in December 1988, the Jazz chose Sloan as the new head coach.[11] Sloan enjoyed a successful run of 16 consecutive seasons of taking his team to the playoffs, during which time he coached Hall of Famers Karl Malone and John Stockton, along with other players including Jeff Hornacek, Antoine Carr, Tom Chambers, Mark Eaton, and Jeff Malone. Sloan led the Jazz to six division championships and 10 seasons with greater than 50 wins. He also took the Jazz to the NBA Finals twice, losing in 1997 and 1998, both times to his old team, the Michael Jordan-led Bulls. By the end of this period, he had joined Pat Riley and Phil Jackson as the only coaches with 10 or more seasons winning 50 or more games. After the retirement of long-time Jazz players Malone and Stockton, Sloan coached a younger group of players, including Carlos Boozer, Andrei Kirilenko, Mehmet Okur, and later, Deron Williams. After John Stockton retired and Karl Malone signed with the Lakers in the summer of 2003, the 2003-2004 Jazz were widely predicted to be the worst team in the NBA [12] and some even predicted that Utah would set the all-time single season record for fewest wins in a season.[13] Despite the very low expectations and despite second leading scorer Matt Harpring being sidelined for 51 games due to a knee injury, Sloan and his team were involved in a battle for the eighth spot in the Western Conference, which would have given Sloan his 17th straight trip to the playoffs. The Jazz were tied with the Denver Nuggets for the eighth and last spot of the playoffs with three games to go in the regular season. The Jazz lost the final two games, causing Sloan to miss the playoffs for the first time in 18 seasons as Jazz coach. After leading a young team in its first year without Stockton and Malone to an unexpected 42–40 record, he finished just behind Hubie Brown of the Memphis Grizzlies in voting for the 2004 NBA Coach of the Year Award. Sloan collected his 1,000th career win against the Dallas Mavericks on December 11, 2006, in a 101–79 victory, which made him only the fifth coach in NBA history to reach the milestone.[14] After disappointing seasons in 2004–05 and 2005–06, the strong play of the Jazz in the 2006–07 season had renewed speculation from some sportswriters[according to whom?] that Sloan would be a strong candidate for Coach of the Year in 2007. However, Sloan lost the award to Toronto Raptors head coach Sam Mitchell, who led his team to a franchise record-tying 47 victories and their first Atlantic Division title. Sloan lost the vote 394–301.[15] The Jazz advanced to the Western Conference finals on May 15, 2007, with a 100–87 win over the Golden State Warriors. It was the sixth time in franchise history that Utah advanced to the conference finals, all coming under Sloan. However, they went on to lose 4–1 to the San Antonio Spurs. During the 2008–09 season, Sloan reached 1,000 wins as coach of the Jazz on November 7 after beating the Oklahoma City Thunder 104–97 in a Friday night game. He became the first coach in NBA history with 1,000 wins for one team.[16] Sloan returned as head coach of the Jazz for the 2009–10 season, leading the team to a 53–29 record and the playoffs. Mirroring his tenacity as a player, Sloan was just as fiery as a coach. He was suspended one game for pushing referee Bob Delaney in April 1993. A decade later, Sloan was served a seven-game suspension in 2003 for pushing referee Courtney Kirkland in Sacramento.[17] In April 2009, Sloan was named to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, in the same class as his former longtime point guard John Stockton. Sloan chose class of 2006 Hall of Famer Charles Barkley to introduce him during his induction ceremony.[18] Sloan revealed on February 7, 2011, that he had earlier in the year signed a contract extension to coach the Jazz for the 2011–12 season, which would have been his 24th season as head coach with the Jazz.[19] However, on February 10, 2011, Sloan and assistant Phil Johnson resigned their positions effective immediately.[20] Sloan downplayed reports that conflicts with players prompted his departure. ""I've had confrontations with players since I've been in the league"", Sloan said. ""There's only so much energy left and my energy has dropped."" KSL-TV later asked Sloan whether reported conflicts with guard Deron Williams forced him to leave. ""I forced myself out"", Sloan responded.[21] Williams acknowledged that he had a disagreement with Sloan during the previous night's game, but he added, ""I would never force Coach Sloan out of Utah. He's meant more to this town, more to this organization than I have by far. I would have asked out of Utah first.""[22] Sloan's last game as head coach came in a 91–86 loss to the Bulls on February 9, and assistant coach Tyrone Corbin was then named as Sloan's replacement.[3] Nearly two weeks later, Williams was involved in a trade on February 23, 2011, that sent him to the New Jersey Nets.[23] Ian Thomsen of Sports Illustrated wrote, ""First Jerry Sloan leaves, now Williams is sent away. For two decades we knew who the Utah Jazz were and what they stood for as a franchise. Now we, and they, can have no idea.""[24] A year later, Karl Malone, who played under Sloan for over 18 years, indicated that Sloan did not feel supported by Kevin O'Connor and Greg Miller.[25] Longtime San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich would later mention him as a mentor for his overall coaching success in the NBA.[26] On June 19, 2013, the Utah Jazz announced that Sloan was returning as an adviser and scouting consultant.[4] On January 31, 2014, the Jazz honored Sloan by raising a banner featuring the number ""1223"", which represents Sloan wins with the Jazz from 1988 to 2011.[27] Sloan married his high-school sweetheart, Bobbye. After a well-publicized six-year battle against breast cancer, she died of pancreatic cancer in 2004.[28] They had three children and were married 41 years. One of his sons, Brian, was an all-state center for McLeansboro High School and was a member of its undefeated 1984 Class A IHSA basketball championship team. After leading the Foxes to the championship, Brian Sloan was named Mr. Basketball and was a McDonald's All-American for 1984 in Illinois. Brian Sloan also played five seasons under Coach Bob Knight at Indiana University, collecting an NCAA title in 1987. Brian's son, and Jerry's grandson, Grant is a member of the Indiana University baseball team.[29] In 2006, Jerry Sloan married Tammy Jessop, in Salt Lake City.

A two-time state basketball player of the year, Snyder led the team to the 1985 state championship. During this time Mercer Island achieved a No. 1 ranking in USA Today's high school polls. Snyder was named a McDonald's All American player, being the first chosen from the state of Washington.[2][4][5] At Duke University, Snyder was a point guard for the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team from 1985 to 1989, and his team played in the Final Four in 1986, 1988, and 1989. Snyder became a starter in his second season (1987) and started almost all games the remainder of his career.[6] He was elected a team captain and honored as an Academic All-American during his senior season. He graduated from Duke in 1989 with a double major in philosophy and political science, and, later received a J.D. degree from Duke Law School in 1995 and an M.B.A. degree from the Duke Fuqua School of Business in 1995.[7] In the middle of his graduate work, Snyder spent the 1992–93 NBA season as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers.[7] From 1993 to 1995, Snyder served as an administrative assistant to men's basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski while Snyder completed his MBA and JD at Duke. After completing both degrees in 1995, Snyder became a full-time assistant coach under Krzyzewski. In 1997, Duke promoted Snyder to associate head coach.[7] During Snyder's time as a Duke assistant coach, Duke made the 1994 and 1999 NCAA tournament championship rounds and the Elite Eight round in 1998. Duke also won the ACC tournament in 1999.[8] In 1999, Snyder accepted the head coaching position for the University of Missouri Tigers men's basketball team, succeeding longtime coach Norm Stewart. He eventually led the Tigers to four consecutive NCAA Tournament berths, including the Elite Eight in 2002, matching the deepest run ever made by a Missouri team in the NCAA Tournament.[9] Snyder was hailed as a sensation upon his arrival at Missouri. His first team knocked off a ranked Illinois team and then defeated Kansas in Snyder's first game against Mizzou's archrival. Snyder's second season was punctuated by similar success. He once again toppled a ranked Kansas team and led the Tigers to their first NCAA victory since 1995. The eventual 2001 NCAA National Champion Duke ended the Tigers' season in the NCAA Tournament.[10] He was named Rookie Coach of the Year by the Basketball Times after the season.[9] In the summer of 2003, Snyder was an assistant coach for United States at the Pan American Games.[9] In May 2004, Snyder was named in 17 allegations as a part of an NCAA investigation over recruiting violations, centering on improper gifts to guard Ricky Clemons.[11] The program was placed on a three-year probation that November after the NCAA infractions committee ruled that an assistant bought meals, provided transportation and illegally contacted recruits. The committee rejected claims by the school that the rule violations were inadvertent, although it also dismissed charges of major violations, including the Clemons' claim that assistant coaches paid players cash.[12] Snyder later admitted to having players at his house for ""an occasional meal"" and giving Clemons clothing.[13] Snyder resigned as coach on February 10, 2006 following a 26-point loss to Baylor that extended a losing streak to six and dropped the Tigers to a 10-11 record overall, 3-7 in the Big 12. He finished with a 126-91 record over seven years, reaching the NCAA tournament in each of his first four seasons but posting only a 42-42 record since.[14] After his resignation, Snyder accused Missouri athletic director Mike Alden of sending Gary Link, a basketball analyst and assistant to Alden, to inform him that he would be fired after the season.[15] Following his departure from Missouri in 2006, Snyder initially gave up on coaching for good.[13] But in May 2007, he accepted the head coaching position of the Austin Toros in the NBADL[16] In the first season, Snyder's team won the Southwest Division championship and reached the D-League Finals. In his second season, Snyder led the Toros to a 32-win season; coached in the 2009 NBA D-League All-Star Game in Phoenix; received the Dennis Johnson Coach of the Year award; and reached the D-League Semi-Finals. In his final season with the team, the Toros compiled another 32-win season – this time with more rookies than any other team in the D-League – and again reached the Semi-Finals. During his three-year tenure in Austin, Snyder compiled more wins and guided more players to the NBA than any other coach in the D-League.[17] Snyder became a player development coach for the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA on June 11, 2010 working under Doug Collins.[18] Soon afterward, Snyder began training draft prospects in workouts preceding the 2010 NBA draft, including future 76ers player Evan Turner.[19] The 76ers finished 41-41 in the 2010–11 season. On July 1, 2011, NBA team Los Angeles Lakers hired Snyder as an assistant under coach Mike Brown.[20] In a season shorted by a lockout, the Lakers finished the 2011–12 season in first place in the Pacific Division with a 41-25 record. The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference semi-finals. On July 8, 2012, the European powerhouse team CSKA Moscow of the Russian Professional Basketball League hired Snyder as the head assistant coach under Ettore Messina.[21] CSKA reached the Euroleague Final Four this season, but lost to eventual champion Olympiacos Piraeus in the semi-final round.[22] On June 10, 2013, the Atlanta Hawks hired Snyder as the head assistant coach.[23] On June 6, 2014, Snyder was hired by the Utah Jazz to be the team's head coach.[24] He reportedly signed a three-year deal with a team option for a fourth season.[25] Snyder previously worked with Jazz general manager Dennis Lindsey from 2007 to 2010 when Lindsey was an assistant general manager with the San Antonio Spurs and Snyder coached the Toros, the Spurs' D-League affiliate.[26] On May 6, 2016, the Jazz announced a long-term contract extension for coach Snyder.[27] In June 2018, Snyder was named a finalist for NBA Coach of the Year[28] On October 19, 2019 the Jazz signed Snyder to a new contract extension.[29][30] *Resigned before the season ended; Melvin Watkins became interim coach afterwards, and Missouri finished the 2005–06 season 12–16 (5–11 Big 12) and 11th in the Big 12.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/281.png

Soar played nine seasons for the New York Giants (1937–1944, 1946), and caught the game-winning touchdown pass in the 1938 NFL Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers at the Polo Grounds. Born in Alton, Rhode Island, Soar later moved to Pawtucket, attending Pawtucket Senior High School (currently William E. Tolman High School) and Providence College. After being named to the Little All-American team, he left college to play semi-pro baseball and pro football, playing for the Boston Shamrocks in 1936.[1] He served in the Army during World War II, and his officiating in a baseball game drew the attention of Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack, who recommended him for an umpiring career. After the war, Soar coached the Providence Steamrollers in the Basketball Association of America (now the NBA) in 1947, but the team achieved only a 2-17 record before he was replaced by Nat Hickey. He then became backfield coach for the football team at Rhode Island State College (also known as the University of Rhode Island) from 1947 to 1949.[1] After working in the New England League from 1947 to 1949 and the American Association in 1949,[1] Soar became an American League umpire from 1950 to 1972, and as a league supervisor continued to work occasional games as a substitute through 1975 and in 1977-78. He worked in five World Series (1953, 1956, 1962, 1964 and 1969), serving as crew chief for the '69 Series between the New York Mets and the Baltimore Orioles, one of the most famous of all-time. Soar was also the first base umpire when Don Larsen of the New York Yankees pitched a perfect game in Game 5 of the 1956 Series, and was again at first base on June 1, 1975 when Nolan Ryan of the California Angels pitched his fourth no-hitter to tie Sandy Koufax's major league record. Soar also officiated in four All-Star Games (1952, 1955, second 1959 game, 1963), calling balls and strikes for the last contest, as well as the 1971 American League Championship Series, when he again served as crew chief. In 1941, Soar made a bit of history as one of the first two players ever to be fined by the NFL's league office when commissioner Elmer Layden in August assessed $25 fines on Soar and Green Bay Packers quarterback Larry Craig for fighting.[2] Soar died at age 87 at a family home in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and was buried in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.

Of Filipino descent from his mother's side, he is the first Asian-American head coach in the history of the four major North American sports leagues[2][3] and the first Asian-American head coach to win an NBA championship.[3] From 2001 to 2008, Spoelstra served as assistant coach and director of scouting for the team.[4] Thereafter he was promoted to head coach. Prior to the 2010–11 season, team President Pat Riley assembled a superstar trio of free agents LeBron James and Chris Bosh joining Dwyane Wade. While Spoelstra was head coach, the Heat made four consecutive finals appearances, with trips to the 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 NBA Finals, winning the championship in both 2012 and 2013. Born in Evanston, Illinois, Spoelstra later spent his childhood in Buffalo, New York then Portland, Oregon by the late 1970s[5][6] where he attended Raleigh Hills Elementary and Whitford Jr. High School. Spoelstra attended Jesuit High School in Beaverton, Oregon, where he excelled at point guard on the basketball team.[5] He wore number 30 during high school and later in college in honor of then Trail Blazer Terry Porter, one of his favorite NBA players.[7] Before his senior year, Spoelstra participated in Sonny Vaccaro's Nike All-Star camp in Princeton, New Jersey alongside future NBA players Alonzo Mourning, Shawn Kemp, Billy Owens, and Bobby Hurley.[5] Spoelstra received basketball scholarship offers, and eventually accepted one from the University of Portland in his hometown.[5] In 1989, he was named West Coast Conference freshman of the year.[8] Spoelstra was the Pilots' starting point guard for four years, averaging 9.2 points, 4.4 assists, and 2.4 rebounds per game.[8] He is a member of the school's 1,000-point club, and is among the Pilots' career leaders in several statistical categories.[8] During a 1990 WCC Basketball Tournament game against Loyola Marymount, Spoelstra was on the court standing just a couple of yards away from Hank Gathers when Gathers collapsed and later died of a heart condition.[5] Spoelstra graduated from the University of Portland in 1992 with a degree in communications.[9] After graduating from the University of Portland, he was hired and spent two years (1993–1995) in Basketball Bundesliga's second division as a player–assistant coach for TuS Herten, a German professional basketball club based in Westphalia, Germany.[10][11][12] It was in this setting where Spoelstra got his first coaching job, as coach of the club's local youth team.[5] He began having back problems after the end of his second year with the team, and contemplated having surgery.[13] In 1995, Spoelstra was offered another two-year contract with the club, but the NBA's Miami Heat also offered him a position. Although both offers held appeal, he chose to take the Heat position.[7] Roya Vaziri, then the director of player personnel for the Heat, convinced then general manager Dave Wohl to offer Spoelstra a position with the team.[14] Spoelstra was hired as the Heat's video coordinator in 1995, although at first he was not promised the position past the summer of that year.[7] Pat Riley was named the Heat's head coach not long after Spoelstra's hiring. Erik's father, Jon Spoelstra, said, ""Contractually, Riley wasn’t allowed to bring in his video guy, otherwise, Erik would have been out of a job right then.""[13] After two years as video coordinator, he then served two years as an assistant coach/video coordinator. Spoelstra was promoted to assistant coach/advance scout in 1999, and later became the Heat's assistant coach/director of scouting in 2001.[4] Many of Spoelstra's colleagues attribute his ascent in the Heat coaching ranks to his strong work ethic.[5][14] As an assistant coach, he was credited for improving Heat star shooting guard Dwyane Wade's balance and jump shot after Wade's return from the 2004 Summer Olympics.[3] Spoelstra won his first NBA championship as an assistant coach when the Miami Heat defeated the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Finals. In April 2008, Spoelstra became the head coach of the Miami Heat after Pat Riley's decision to step down. Spoelstra was Riley's hand-picked successor.[16] In naming Spoelstra as head coach, Riley said: ""This game is now about younger coaches who are technologically skilled, innovative, and bring fresh new ideas. That's what we feel we are getting with Erik Spoelstra. He's a man that was born to coach.""[4] Spoelstra became the first ever Asian-American NBA head coach, and the first Asian-American head coach in the history of the four major North American sports leagues.[3] He led the Heat to the NBA Playoffs in his first year as head coach, despite the team's league worst record of 15-67 the previous season.[17] The Heat, however, were defeated in seven games by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round. Spoelstra's team once again reached the postseason the following season, but again lost in the first round to the Boston Celtics in five games.[17] Expectations of the team's success were raised significantly for the next season and beyond, after the free agent acquisitions of LeBron James and Chris Bosh in the summer of 2010. After the team started off the 2010–11 season with a 9–8 record, some Heat players reportedly were ""frustrated"" with Spoelstra, and questioned if he should remain their head coach.[18] Chris Bosh intimated that the team was being worked too hard and that the players would rather ""chill"".[19] LeBron James famously bumped into Spoelstra on his way to the bench during a timeout in a game.[20] These two issues, coupled with the relatively poor start to the season, put Spoelstra on the coaching hot seat. The team bounced-back, however, and made the playoffs while posting the second best record in the Eastern Conference. Spoelstra led the Heat to an appearance in the 2011 NBA Finals, but lost to the Dallas Mavericks in six games. After Spoelstra failed to win a championship during his first season as head coach of the ""big three"", Heat executive Pat Riley was asked if he would consider returning to coach the team.[21] Riley, however, turned down the idea and supported Spoelstra as the head coach going forward.[21] Spoelstra received a $6 million contract extension in December 2011 which lasted through the 2013–14 NBA season.[22] The following season Spoelstra again guided the team to the postseason as the two seed. The Heat overcame a 2–1 game deficit against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference semi-finals, and a 3–2 game deficit against the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals to reach the 2012 NBA Finals despite an injury to starter Chris Bosh that forced him to miss nine straight games.[23] Spoelstra's Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games to win the NBA championship. He became the first Asian-American head coach to win an NBA championship,[3] and the second Heat head coach to win the title. He also became the only Miami Heat head coach to take the team to the NBA Finals multiple times. During the 2012–13 season, Spoelstra was selected as head coach of the 2013 Eastern Conference All-Stars in the 2013 NBA All-Star Game, with the Heat holding the best record in the Eastern Conference at the time of selection. He later coached the Heat to a 27-game winning streak (second longest in NBA history). It started with a 100–85 win over the Toronto Raptors on February 3, 2013, and ended with a 97–101 loss to the Chicago Bulls on March 27, 2013. The team made the playoffs as the one seed while posting the best overall NBA regular season record. After sweeping the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, the Heat won a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals, and advanced to face the San Antonio Spurs in the 2013 NBA Finals. The Heat defeated the Spurs in seven games and became the first team to win two straight titles since the 2009–2010 Los Angeles Lakers. Spoelstra also became the eighth coach to lead his team to two straight championships. On September 29, 2013, the Heat extended Spoelstra's contract to an undisclosed multi-year deal. Details were not released, but Spoelstra was expected to receive a pay raise and a bigger role in the front office. Spoelstra led the Heat to the 2014 NBA Finals, becoming the third coach to lead his team to four straight Finals. The Heat faced the San Antonio Spurs once again, only this time losing the series in five games.[24][25] On December 16, 2017, Spoelstra got his 455th win as the head coach of the Heat and passed Riley for most wins in franchise history, when they defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 90–85.[26] Spoelstra is the only son and the younger of two children of Jon Spoelstra and Elisa Celino.[7][27] Jon is Dutch-Irish-American and a former NBA executive of the Buffalo Braves, Portland Trail Blazers, Denver Nuggets, and New Jersey Nets.[4][28] Elisa, is a native of San Pablo, Laguna, Philippines.[29] Spoelstra is also the grandson of Watson Spoelstra, a long-time sportswriter for The Detroit News.[13] On September 17, 2015, Spoelstra announced his engagement to former Miami Heat cheerleader, Nikki Sapp.[30] They married on July 22, 2016. Spoelstra has also been an active participant in the SportsUnited Sports Envoy program for the U.S. Department of State. In this function, the Filipino-American coach has traveled to the Philippines two times between 2009 and 2014, where he worked with Derrick Alston, Alison Feaster, David Fizdale, and Sue Wicks to conduct basketball clinics and events that reached more than 375 youth from underserved areas.

He graduated in 1966, and he was recruited by about 100 universities.[2] Staak attended St. John's University as a freshman, taking business courses. However, living off-campus didn't provide the atmosphere he was looking for, and when he decided that he wanted to someday be a basketball coach and St. John's didn't offer the academic concentration he sought, he transferred to the University of Connecticut.

287,Brad Stevens,"October 22, 1976",,"Zionsville Community in Zionsville, Indiana",DePauw University,2014,2020,7,false,,"""[2]""",/coaches/stevebr99c.html,"Bradley Kent Stevens (born October 22, 1976)[1] is an American professional basketball coach and former collegiate player who is the head coach of the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA) Born and raised in Zionsville, Indiana, Stevens starred on the Zionsville Community High School basketball team, setting four school records. After high school, he attended DePauw University, where he played basketball and earned a degree in economics. He made the all-conference team multiple times and was a three-time Academic All-America nominee. He transitioned into coaching after quitting his job at Eli Lilly and Company, joining the basketball program at Butler University as a volunteer prior to the 2000–01 season. He was promoted to a full-time assistant coach the following season. After five seasons in the role, he assumed the position of head coach on April 4, 2007, after Todd Lickliter left to coach the Iowa Hawkeyes. In his first year, Stevens led Butler to 30 wins, becoming the third-youngest head coach in NCAA Division I history to have a 30-win season. In 2010, his third year as head coach, Stevens broke the NCAA record for most wins in a coach's first three years, exceeding the previous record by eight wins. In the NCAA Tournament, Stevens coached Butler to the first Final Four in school history, while also becoming the second-youngest head coach to make a NCAA National Championship game, losing 61–59 to Duke. With the following season's team also making the Final Four, Stevens became the youngest coach to go to two Final Fours.[2] Stevens coached the Bulldogs in their second consecutive national championship game on April 4, 2011, where the team again lost, this time to the Connecticut Huskies. Stevens was regularly named a finalist for Horizon League Coach of the Year award, winning twice, and was also a nominee for both the Hugh Durham Award and Jim Phelan Award in every year of his college career. This success garnered him a job with the NBA's Boston Celtics in 2013, when he signed a six-year, $22-million-dollar contract to become head coach.[3] After undertaking a rebuild early in his career, Stevens has led the Celtics to the NBA Playoffs every year since 2015, won a division championship, and appeared in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2017 and 2018.[4][5] He has gained a reputation as one of the NBA's best coaches, with his motion offense and stingy defense earning plaudits from fans, peers, and players.[5][6] Stevens grew up in Zionsville, Indiana, where he developed his love for basketball.[7] Starting at age five, Stevens would watch taped basketball games ""before he went to afternoon kindergarten"".[8] His father often drove him to Bloomington to watch Indiana Hoosiers games.[9] ""It's hard not to be [in love with basketball] when you're a kid growing up in Indiana"", Stevens later said.[10] For his eighth birthday, Stevens received a new basketball hoop. ""It’s so much fun to dream in your driveway,"" he later remarked. ""That’s where my friends and I hung out. It was a lot of fun to grow up in that era.""[11] When a friend, Brandon Monk, had a basketball court installed in his back yard, Stevens ""appeared instantaneously.""[11] He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for grilled cheese sandwiches to Monk's house so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook.[11] Monk's court soon became a gathering place, where kids from Zionsville and the surrounding areas would hold pickup games.[11] These games helped develop Stevens's competitive streak.[11] Besides playing basketball, the young Stevens also enjoyed solving puzzles, a skill he later applied to analyzing opposing teams to find their weaknesses.[8] Stevens attended Zionsville Community High School, where he became a star basketball player.[7] He wore No. 31 in high school in honor of Indiana Pacers guard Reggie Miller.[12] During his freshman year, he got up early to practice shooting at a local gym before school.[13] The hard work paid off as Stevens made the varsity team that year.[13] By the time his high school career was complete, Stevens had set school records for career scoring, assists, steals, and three-point field goals. As of 2017, he still holds the records for career points per game average (26.8), total career points (1508), assists (444), and steals (156), as well as the single-season points record (644 in 1995).[14] Stevens was named to the all-conference team three times. In 1995, he was the sectional MVP and the leading scorer in state sectional play (32.3 ppg).[15] Stevens made the academic all-state first team and received the Straight A Gold Medal Award all four years.[15] He was a member of the National Honor Society, graduating seventh in his class of 165.[15] He earned three letters in basketball, three in track, and one in baseball during his days at Zionsville.[15] During summers, he traveled the country playing AAU basketball.[8] Despite his strong passion for the game, Stevens realized that his basketball skills were modest and not likely to get him very far.[11] He chose to attend academically oriented DePauw University,[9] where he played in all 101 DePauw games, earning four varsity letters.[15] He earned multiple all-conference and academic all-conference awards, and was a three-time Academic All-America nominee.[15][16] He was a team captain his senior year, and averaged more than 8 points per game three of his four years.[11][17] His career highs were 24 points and 8 rebounds in a game.[15] After his senior year, Stevens received the Coaches’ Award.[15] Coach Bill Fenlon later described Stevens as ""one of the most selfless, team-oriented person [sic] I've ever been around.""[16] At DePauw, Stevens was a member of the Management Fellows Honors Program and the DePauw Community Services’ Sports Night executive board.[15] He was also a brother of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.[15] During summer vacations, Stevens spent time teaching at Butler basketball camps.[18] He was named to the Dean's list and graduated in 1999 with a degree in economics.[15] In the summer of 2000, Stevens was offered the opportunity to volunteer in the Butler basketball office.[10] He ran the idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then-longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy. She thought about it for two hours before telling him to go for it.[19] ""Now, it looks like a great idea,"" Stevens later remarked. ""At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try.""[10] Tracy began law school to get a J.D. degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Stevens.[19] ""We were 23 and realized this was our chance,"" Tracy later said. ""Five years down the road, we were probably not going to be in a position to do that. The more success you had at Lilly, the harder it would be to leave.""[19] Stevens planned to live in a friend's basement and took a job at Applebee’s to pay the bills.[11][19] Before he started training at Applebee's, he was offered a low-paying administrative position as coordinator of basketball operations under then-coach Thad Matta.[7][10] The position had opened up when assistant coach Jamal Meeks resigned after being arrested on solicitation and drug charges, of which he was later acquitted.[11] Years later, Matta recalled, ""[Stevens] was just a hungry young kid that was desperate to get into coaching. He had a great passion and was willing to take a risk to get into the coaching profession.""[11] After Matta left the school following the 2000–01 season, new head coach Todd Lickliter promoted Stevens to a full-time assistant coach.[7] Under Lickliter, Stevens was active in every aspect of the game: skills instruction, game preparation, in-game coaching, and recruiting.[7] Butler was 131–61 during Stevens' time as an assistant coach.[20] On April 2, 2007, Lickliter resigned in order to take the head-coaching position at the University of Iowa.[10] The Butler players had a meeting with athletic director Barry Collier, urging him to promote from within.[21] Collier, having spent the entire season observing the assistant coaches' interaction with the team, agreed.[10] The day after Lickliter resigned Stevens and Butler's two other assistant coaches interviewed for the job.[18] Within 24 hours of the interviews Stevens was named Butler's new head coach.[10] According to Collier, Stevens had something older, outside candidates could never match: six years of experience learning the Butler system, dubbed ""The Butler Way"" by Collier.[18] ""Age wasn't a factor because I'd seen his ability shine through during the course of the season,"" Collier said.[18] At the start of the 2007–08 season, Stevens was the second youngest coach in Division I basketball.[18] He got off to a fast start, winning his first eight games before falling to Wright State 43–42.[22] Legendary coach Bob Knight, whose Texas Tech team was an early victim, said ""I wish we played as smart as they do.""[23] Virginia Tech coach Seth Greenberg added ""they've got toughness about them and they expect to win.""[23] Midway through Stevens' first season, with the Bulldogs at 12–1, The New York Times wrote ""so far, Stevens has made the transition [to head coach] look easy.""[13] The Times went on to state that Stevens had the calm and composure of a seasoned veteran.[13] ""You’ve got a lot of people always looking for the next step. And that’s not what I was doing. I was just trying to figure out a way to win the next game and think like a head coach."" Stevens said.[13] Butler ended the regular season with a 27–3 record, taking first place in the Horizon League with a 16–2 in conference mark.[22] The team beat Illinois-Chicago 66–50 and Cleveland State 70–55 to claim the league's tournament title and an automatic bid to the 2008 NCAA tournament.[22] Butler was awarded the seven seed in the East Regional. They beat tenth-seeded South Alabama 81–61 in the first round, before falling to second-seeded Tennessee 76–71 in overtime.[22] Stevens ended up with a school and Horizon league record 30 wins, beating several big name schools – Michigan, Texas Tech, Florida State, Ohio State – along the way.[13][17] In so doing, he became the third-youngest head coach in NCAA Division I history to lead a team to 30 wins in a season, and became the fourth-winningest first-year coach.[17] Butler was nationally ranked for a school and league record 19 consecutive weeks.[17] Butler's 30–4 record was the best among teams that did not reach the Final Four.[24] Stevens was a finalist for the Hugh Durham Award, losing to Keno Davis of Drake,[25] and a finalist for the Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year Award, losing to Bo Ryan.[26] At the conclusion of the season, Butler signed Stevens to a seven-year contract. ""We are extremely excited to reach this long-term agreement to have Brad continue to lead our program,"" Collier remarked.[24] Butler lost four starters after the 2007–08 season, and was picked to finish fifth in the Horizon league during the 2008–09 season.[17] The team got off to a 12–1 start that won Stevens the Hugh Durham mid-season coaching award.[27] On February 5, Stevens notched his 50th win as Butler beat Detroit 66–61. In so doing, Stevens became the sixth head coach in NCAA history to reach 50 wins in 56 games or fewer.[28] Butler finished first in the Horizon League with a 15–3 in conference record, defying preseason expectations.[29] Butler lost the Horizon League tournament final 57–54 to Cleveland State, but made the NCAA tournament as an at-large selection.[17][29] The team received the nine seed in the South Regional, and lost to eighth-seeded Louisiana State in the first round by a score of 75–71 to finish the year at 26–6 overall.[29] Stevens' 56–10 two-year record places him second only to Bill Guthridge (58) in total wins during one's first two years as head coach.[17] Stevens was a finalist for both the Hugh Durham and Jim Phelan Awards for the second straight year and was named the Horizon League Coach of the Year.[17][30][31] He was also named as a finalist for the Henry Iba Coach of the Year Award.[32] Stevens was given a one-year contract extension at the conclusion of the season.[33] Fueled in large part by Gordon Hayward's and Shelvin Mack's roles in leading Team USA to the gold medal in the FIBA Under-19 World Championship during the off-season,[34] Butler began the season ranked 10th in the Coaches' Poll and 11th in the AP Poll.[35] A few commentators picked the Bulldogs as a possible ""sleeper team"" to make the Final Four. Stevens was not so sure, privately telling his father, ""We have a really good team, and I’m not sure how far we can go this year, but next year, we ought to go really far.""[36] Butler got off to a mediocre start, losing twice in the 76 Classic 82–73 to 22nd-ranked Minnesota and to 19th-ranked Clemson 70–69.[37][38] After the tournament Butler's record stood at 4–2 and the team dropped to #23 in the AP Poll and #20 in the Coaches' Poll.[39] Butler won its next two games before falling to 13th-ranked Georgetown 72–65 in the Jimmy V Classic.[40] The team won its next two games beating #15 Ohio State 74–66 and edging out former conference rival Xavier 69–68, both at home.[40] After losing 67–57 at UAB three days later,[40] Butler stood at 9–4 and fell out of the AP rankings. However, the team remained in the Coaches Poll at #23.[41] Stevens rallied the team, and they proceeded to win 16 straight games before facing Siena in a BracketBusters game.[40] Butler beat Siena 70–53 and Stevens tied the NCAA record for most wins (81) by a head coach in his first three seasons set by Mark Few of Gonzaga in 2002 and tied by Mark Fox of Nevada in 2007.[42][43] On February 26, 2010, Butler traveled to Valparaiso for their regular season finale. Leading scorer Gordon Hayward was sidelined with lower back pain, but the team still won 74–69.[44] In so doing, Stevens broke the coaching record he had tied the prior week and Butler completed an 18–0 undefeated conference schedule. It was Butler's first undefeated conference record since joining the Horizon League, and first since Joe Sexson led the 1978 team to a 6–0 record in the now defunct Indiana Collegiate Conference.[45] Stevens earned his third straight regular-season conference championship. In the Horizon league tournament, Stevens' Bulldogs used their home-court advantage to beat Milwaukee 68–59 in the semi-finals[46] and to beat Wright State 70–45 in the finals.[47] The win earned the team an automatic bid into the 2010 NCAA tournament, and completed a 20–0 run through league play. Stevens became the first coach to lead a Horizon League team to both an undefeated regular season and conference tournament since the league was formed in 1979.[48] Stevens was also the only coach in Division I to lead his team to an undefeated conference schedule during the 2009–10 season.[47] For their season, the Bulldogs were ranked 8th in the final pre-NCAA tournament Coaches' Poll and 11th in the corresponding AP Poll.[49] On Selection Sunday, the Bulldogs were seeded fifth in the West regional of the NCAA tournament and given a first-round match up with twelfth seeded UTEP on March 18.[50] Many basketball commentators picked UTEP to pull the upset,[36] and at halftime it looked like they might be right, as UTEP led 33–27. Stevens made a number of halftime adjustments, and the Bulldogs came out firing on all cylinders in the second half. The team dominated the second half and won the game 77–59.[51] Butler next faced off with thirteenth seeded Murray State. The game was close throughout, but Butler emerged victorious 54–52 when Hayward deflected a Murray State pass into the back court with less than five seconds on the clock. The win gave Stevens the first Sweet Sixteen appearance of his career.[52] On March 25, 2010, Butler faced top-seeded Syracuse. The Bulldogs got off to a good start, jumping out to a 12–1 lead and a 35–25 halftime advantage. Syracuse rallied in the second half, taking its first lead of the game, 40–39, off a Wes Johnson three-pointer. Stevens called timeout and Butler regained the lead on its next possession, stopping the run. At the 5:32 mark, Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity that ended with a dunk and 54–50 lead. Stevens again called time out and re-focused the team. Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes, taking a 60–54 lead with 0:59 to go. Butler held on to win 63–59, advancing to the Elite Eight for the first time in school history.[53] Two days later, Stevens' Bulldogs met second-seeded Kansas State in the regional finals. Perhaps feeling the effects of their double overtime 101–96 win two days prior, Kansas State got off to a slow start, scoring just 20 points in the first half to trail 27–20. Butler kept the lead in the upper single digits for most of the second half, before Kansas State went on a 13–2 run and took a 52–51 lead. Stevens immediately called time out and re-focused the team. ""Play your game. Just play your game,"" he told them.[54] On the ensuing possession, Butler regained the lead for good. They outscored Kansas State 12–4 the rest of the way and won the game 63–56.[55] In the post game celebration, Stevens and walk-on forward Emerson Kampen connected on a flying back-bump that became one of the iconic images of the tournament.[56] The win earned the Bulldogs a trip back to Indianapolis for the first Final Four appearance in school and Horizon League history.[55] The win made Stevens, at age 33, the youngest coach to lead a team to the Final Four since Bob Knight made his first Final Four appearance at age 32 in 1973.[10] Butler became the smallest school (enrollment 4,200) to make the Final Four since seeding began in 1979.[57] On April 3, Stevens and the Butler Bulldogs faced off with Michigan State in the national semi-finals. Michigan State took an early 14–7 lead, and Matt Howard got in early foul trouble, sitting most the first half. Stevens kept the team focused with a ""next man up"" attitude and the game was tied at 28 at halftime.[58] The second half was dominated by tight defense for both sides. With 2:45 to go in the game, the score was 47–44 Butler. Michigan State called a time out to set up a play. Stevens correctly anticipated the play call and had Ronald Nored, the team's best defender, switch onto Korie Lucious off a screen. Nored stole the ball and Shawn Vanzant got fouled on the resulting run out, hitting 1 of 2. Trailing 50–49 with under 30 seconds remaining, Michigan State came up empty and was forced to foul. Nored hit both foul shots, giving Butler a 52–49 lead. After a Michigan State time out, Stevens had his team foul Lucious with 2 seconds remaining to prevent a potentially game tying 3-pointer. After making the first, Lucious intentionally missed the second free throw. Hayward came down with the rebound to seal the victory.[58] Butler became the first team since the shot clock was adopted for the 1985–86 season to hold five straight tournament opponents under 60 points.[59] On April 5, 2010, Butler and Duke faced off in what The New York Times called ""the most eagerly awaited championship game in years"".[60] Late in the first half, Duke went on an 8–0 run to take a 26–20 lead. Stevens called a timeout. With starters Matt Howard and Ronald Nored on the bench in foul trouble, Stevens was forced to call on backup center Avery Jukes who came up big for Butler. Jukes scored 10 first half points, tying his season high. At half time, Duke's lead stood at 33–32.[61] The second half was played very closely, with neither team taking a substantial lead. With 3:16 to play, Duke took a 60–55 lead on two made free throws by Nolan Smith. Butler cut the lead to one point in the final minute and, after a missed Kyle Singler jump shot with 36 seconds remaining, got a chance to retake the lead. Butler was unable to initiate their offense and Stevens called a timeout to set up a play. A failed inbounds attempt and a timeout later, Hayward missed a baseline fade-away jumper and Brian Zoubek came down with the rebound for Duke. He was quickly fouled with less than 4 seconds remaining. Hayward narrowly missed a desperation half-court shot as time expired, making the final margin 61–59.[61] The loss snapped Butler's 25-game winning streak, the longest in school history. Butler became the smallest school to play for a National Championship since Jacksonville in 1970.[62] Stevens became the second-youngest head coach to coach in the NCAA National Championship Game, behind Branch McCracken who led the Indiana Hoosiers to the 1940 National Championship at age 31.[62] Stevens was named as both a Hugh Durham and Jim Phelan Award finalist for the third consecutive year, losing to Mike Young and Jamie Dixon respectively.[63][64] He was also a finalist for the Skip Prosser Man of the Year Award, which was won by Bob Marlin.[65] Butler finished the year ranked #2 in the Coaches' Poll, the highest ranking in school history.[66] The school was ranked for 19 consecutive weeks, tying the school record.[66] After the end of the 2009–10 season, Stevens and Butler continued to attract considerable attention. President Barack Obama personally called Stevens to congratulate him on Butler's season.[67] David Letterman had Stevens on his show for a guest appearance.[67] Butler admissions inquiries increased by 67%.[67] Stevens received fan letters from around the world, and his phone rang off the hook.[67] He was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch before the Chicago Cubs vs. Florida Marlins game in Chicago on May 10.[68] ""It's all been very surreal,"" Stevens said. ""If you are the runner-up, you don't expect to talk to the president.""[67] ""It's been a little overwhelming, because I'm a pretty simple guy,"" he added.[67] The 2009–10 season also helped increase Butler's recruiting profile.[69] Asked if the increased fame would change things, Stevens said it better not spoil him or the university. ""I look at this new challenge of not changing and sticking to your core values and making sure you remain humble as a great coaching opportunity.""[67] Rankings by ESPN's Andy Katz and Fox Sports' Jeff Goodman released shortly after the 2010 Championship game both had Butler third for the 2010–2011 season.[70][71] Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski agreed, saying Butler would be""right up there, No. 1 or No. 2... They'll be a favorite next year.""[72] However, Hayward chose to leave early for the NBA Draft and Butler went through a rough patch early in the season, at one point losing three straight games and having a 6–5 conference record. Bolstered by the emergence of Andrew Smith at center and Matt Howard's success as a perimeter forward, Butler ended up winning a share of the conference title at 13–5. The Bulldogs then won the Horizon League Tournament to secure an automatic NCAA tournament bid, and received an 8 seed. Picked by many[who?] to lose a first-round match-up against Old Dominion, Butler advanced on a last-second tip-in by Howard. Howard was also clutch in their next game, hitting a free throw with a less than one second remaining to beat Pitt in a dramatic finish. Shelvin Mack scored 30 points in the win. Butler won their next game when they defeated Wisconsin. On March 26, 2011, the Bulldogs beat Florida 74–71 in overtime to earn back-to-back trips to the Final Four. On April 2, Butler beat fellow Cinderella team VCU 70–62 to make it to a second consecutive national championship game. For the second consecutive year, the Bulldogs fell in the national championship game, this time to Connecticut. On April 8, 2010, Stevens signed a long-term deal with Butler, extending his contract through the 2021–22 season.[73] Financial terms of the contract were not disclosed; however, Butler president Bobby Fong had publicly stated that the university could afford to increase Stevens' base salary to approximately US $1,000,000 a few days prior.[74] Stevens had previously made US$395,000 plus benefits in base salary, a relatively low figure for a successful Division I head basketball coach.[75] His total compensation for 2009–10 was estimated at US$750,000.[76] Stevens had received a raise after each of his three seasons at Butler and his contract contains a buyout clause estimated in the high six or low seven figures.[77][78] By re-signing with Butler, Stevens temporarily ended speculation that he would leave the university for a higher paying job.[73] Oregon, Clemson, and Wake Forest were all said to be interested in offering Stevens multi-million dollar contracts to leave Butler.[72][73] ""First and foremost, I’m loyal to Butler,"" Stevens said.[77] When asked if he would ever leave Butler, Stevens replied ""I guess if they kicked me out.""[11] After the 2011–12 season, Stevens was pursued vigorously by Illinois to fill their coaching vacancy before he declined their offer.[80] In March 2013, UCLA reportedly offered Stevens between $2.5 and $3 million a year to leave Butler.[81] Rumors circulated that Stevens was in contract negotiations with UCLA, but ultimately the rumors proved false and Stevens stayed at Butler.[82] Commenting on the situation, a source close to Stevens said ""Brad doesn't understand why people would assume he's leaving.""[82] A few days later, Stevens reiterated that he was very happy at Butler and had no intentions to leave as long as he had the support of the university to continue running the program the ""right way"".[83] On July 3, 2013, Stevens was signed as the head coach for the Boston Celtics to coach in the NBA.[84] In April 2015, in his second season as head coach, Stevens led the Celtics to the 2015 playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference with a 40–42 record.[4] On April 21, 2015, it was announced that Stevens finished fourth in voting for the NBA's Coach of the Year Award.[85] In April 2016, Stevens led the Celtics to their second consecutive playoff appearance as the fifth seed in the 2016 playoffs, finishing the season with a 48–34 record.[5] On April 16, 2015, Stevens was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for April. He led the Celtics to the East’s best record in April at 7–1. The Celtics recorded a 4–0 mark on the road, and closed the month with six consecutive victories – five of them against playoff teams.[86] On February 28, 2016, Stevens was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for February. He guided his squad to an Eastern Conference-best 9–3 record during the month, including a perfect 6–0 mark at home. The Celtics (36–25 overall) finished the month in sole possession of third place in the East behind the Cleveland Cavaliers and Atlantic Division foe the Toronto Raptors.[87] On June 1, 2016, Stevens received a contract extension.[6] On February 3, 2017, Stevens was named the Eastern Conference head coach for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game.[88] In April 2017, in his fourth season as head coach, Stevens led the Celtics to the 2017 playoffs as the first seed in the Eastern Conference with a 53–29 record.[89] They reached the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost to the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.[90] On July 4, 2017, Stevens was reunited with his former college player Gordon Hayward when Hayward signed a contract to play for the Celtics. In the 2017–18 season, the Celtics' roster saw a massive change, as two-time All-Star Isaiah Thomas was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving. Stevens and the Celtics went 55–27, finishing the season as the second seed in the Eastern Conference, despite losing Hayward for the season to a broken ankle in the first game of the season and Irving missing significant playing time due to knee injuries. Despite Irving missing the playoffs, Stevens led the Celtics on a deep playoff run, losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals. Stevens was considered a front runner for the NBA Coach of the Year Award, but lost to Dwane Casey of the Toronto Raptors. According to Stevens, in one of his first games as head coach, he was nervous and ""felt like our team played on edge"" because of it.[91] He decided that a team's play will reflect its coach's mood; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in difficult game situations, while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge. ""I don’t want to lose a game because of my approach,"" he told himself.[91] Accordingly, he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games. He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional, instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms.[92] He does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes, preferring to focus on ""the next play"" rather than what just happened.[54][91] Butler player Willie Veasley explained Butler's 2010 Final Four run by saying, ""When those big runs [by Syracuse and Kansas State] came, Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words. Then he said he believes in us, he loves us and we're going to win the game.""[56] On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player, he does it with ""positive reinforcement, just at a little louder decibel"", according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves.[91] Above all, Stevens wants his players to be confident, not living in fear of being yanked for making a bad play.[91] Externally, Stevens is always calm, but internally he is far from it. ""I'm not as calm as everybody thinks,"" Stevens says.[9] His wife Tracy adds, ""He’s calm and collected, but he’s fiercely competitive. He’s always thinking about how he can beat you.""[92] Former player Joel Cornette says ""Everyone sees Brad as a level-headed, calm and cool coach, but he’s about as competitive of a guy as I know. We would get into it constantly, whether playing two-on-two or arguing about players’ having better college careers.""[11] Stevens spends a lot of time preparing for each game, and always tries to add a few new wrinkles specific to that game's opponent.[92] Sports Illustrated calls Stevens an expert ""on breaking down tape and looking at statistical trends to find opponents' weaknesses.""[21] Former player Ronald Nored agrees: ""We know everything we need to about our opponents, all their tendencies are broken down"" ahead of time.[92] Stevens is a proponent of statistical analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film.[92] ""I think it's a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players"", he explains.[93] For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: ""this [46% defensive field goal percentage] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country"".[93] The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense.[93] In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff.[94] If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the team's play.[94] Stevens's teams are built around solid basketball fundamentals and good teamwork rather than individual basketball skill.[54] His teams are known for their defense, forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes.[9] The secret to basketball – and life – is ""just to do the job to the best of your ability and don't worry about anything else,"" Stevens says.[21] ""Win the next game. Win the next possession. That's our focus. It's boring. It's also the way championships are won"", he says.[95] In short, Stevens is a strong believer in ""The Butler Way"" – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team.[23] ""I tell the players 'the Butler Way' isn't easy to define,"" Stevens says, ""but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball, play with great energy and defend.""[23] Stevens prefers to recruit strong team players instead of going after ""top recruits.""[23] ""The guys we [have] recruited, most of them weren't very highly ranked,"" Stevens says. ""They had very good high school careers or careers at other places (transfers), but for one reason or the other they weren't seen as great players. But they all had intangibles.""[23] Stevens puts a strong emphasis on education and has said he would only recruit a ""one and done"" player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing professionally.[83] Stevens has often been referred to as a coaching prodigy,[79] but is not interested in self-promotion. He instead prefers to deflect the praise he receives to the players, athletic department, and his mentors.[91] He has not been known to posture for more money, or to leak his name for open coaching positions.[91] He has been described as humble, modest, and not ""about the money"".[23][96] The New York Times, USA Today, ESPN, and other commentators attributed Butler's success against teams with superior athletes to Stevens's coaching style.[54][56][92] The Times remarked, ""the Bulldogs are very well prepared for their opponents, and they do not rattle easily"", and says that the resulting confidence has led to the team's success.[92] ""He coaches to his personality and to his strengths,"" Collier says. ""Obviously, he has great rapport and communication ability with his team.""[10] Yahoo! Sports compared Stevens to legendary coach John Wooden, writing ""Brad Stevens is winning at Butler the Wooden way – calm and composed on the sideline.""[91] Wooden agreed, saying, ""I enjoy watching [Stevens] and very much enjoy [Butler's] style of play.""[91] With background at his short Eli Lilly stint, Stevens also gave a priority to mental health in his locker room. He implemented wellness programs and invited Dr. Stephanie Pinder-Amaker, founding director of McLean Hospital's College Mental Health Program, to speak to his players.[97] Stevens is known for projecting a professional, ""corporate"" look from the sidelines.[57] Asked what his life would be like if he had never taken up coaching, he replies ""If everything else remained the same, I would have been as happy as heck... Friends and family and faith, they're going to take the cake over all this stuff.""[98] Stevens met his wife, Tracy (née Wilhelmy), while attending DePauw University.[99] Tracy, who played soccer for DePauw, quickly learned of Brad's love for basketball; on their third date he drove her an hour and a half to attend a high school basketball game.[92] Tracy graduated from Rocky River High School in 1995, and from DePauw in 1999.[19] She returned to school in 2000, driving five hours from Case Western's law school to Indianapolis on weekends to see Stevens.[19] She finished her final year of law school in Indianapolis, and the couple married in August 2003.[19] Tracy works as a labor and employment lawyer,[19] and also serves as Stevens agent.[100] Brad and Tracy Stevens are involved with the American Cancer Society's Coaches Vs. Cancer. He says that the cause really hit home for them after Tracy's mother died of the disease in June 2004.[19][101] The day before Butler's 2010 Final Four appearance, they hosted a fundraiser for the organization.[101] Stevens has also volunteered his time to the Jukes Foundation for Kids, a charity benefiting Ugandan children run by former Butler player Avery Jukes.[102] Stevens remains in close contact with the Butler basketball family; he notably took a one-game leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith, a player on both of Butler's Final Four teams who was dying of cancer; Smith died less than a week later. At the request of Andrew's widow, Sam, Stevens delivered the eulogy at the memorial service on January 17, 2016.[103] Stevens' father, Mark, is an orthopedic surgeon in Indianapolis who played college football for Indiana.[10] His mother, Jan, is a university professor[8] who has previously taught at Butler.[36]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/287.png

After a playing as a forward in Europe and the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), where he was coached by George Karl, Stotts became a part of Karl's coaching staff on multiple teams in the CBA and NBA. He later got opportunities as a head coach for the Atlanta Hawks and Milwaukee Bucks, before helping the Dallas Mavericks win the 2011 NBA Championship as an assistant coach. Born in Cedar Falls, Iowa, Stotts grew up in Illinois, Wisconsin, Guam, and Indiana and graduated from Bloomington High School North in Bloomington, Indiana in 1976.[1][2] Stotts was a member of the 1976 Indiana All-Star Team.[3] Stotts was a starter in all his four seasons with the University of Oklahoma Sooners basketball team and was an Academic All-American selection in his junior and senior seasons and an All-Big Eight Conference selection in his senior season. He graduated from Oklahoma in 1980 with a B.S. in zoology and a Master's in Business Administration from Oklahoma in 1988 on a postgraduate scholarship from the NCAA.[1] Stotts was a second round selection of the Houston Rockets in the 1980 NBA draft, but he could not find a place on the team. He began his professional playing career in Italy before joining George Karl's Continental Basketball Association (CBA) team, the Montana Golden Nuggets, in the early 1980s. He played for the team for three seasons. He then returned to Europe for several seasons, playing in Spain (CB Estudiantes) and France.[1] After retiring as a player, Stotts joined Karl's coaching staff as an assistant with the CBA's Albany Patroons in 1990–91. During his first year, he helped lead the Patroons to an all-time CBA-best 50–6 record. Stotts then coached the CBA's Fort Wayne Fury for one season before rejoining Karl as part of his staff on the Seattle SuperSonics in the NBA. He then moved with Karl to the Milwaukee Bucks in 1998. In 2002, he decided to part ways with Karl and joined the Atlanta Hawks as an assistant coach. He was promoted to head coach 27 games into the season after Lon Kruger was fired.[4] Stotts led the Hawks to a 52–85 record before he was let go and returned to the assistant coaching ranks with the Golden State Warriors. In 2005, he became the head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks.[5] He guided them to the playoffs in his first season, but was fired towards the end of his second season on March 14, 2007. He was hired as an assistant coach for the Dallas Mavericks shortly after Rick Carlisle was hired as head coach in September 2008. He was credited for coordinating the Mavericks' offense that was one of the most efficient in the league in 2010–11, when they won the NBA title.[6] The Portland Trail Blazers hired Stotts as their head coach on August 7, 2012.[7] At the time, his NBA coaching record was 115–168. The Blazers went 33–49 in Stotts's first year, losing their final 13 games to drop out of the playoff race.[8] In Stotts's second season with the Trail Blazers, he coached the team to an overall record of 54–28. They beat the Houston Rockets in the first round of the NBA Playoffs with a buzzer-beating three point shot by Damian Lillard to advance to the second round, but fell short to the eventual NBA champion San Antonio Spurs in the second round, ultimately losing in five games. In Stotts's third season, he led the team to an overall record of 51–31. After sustaining some key injuries, they fell to the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round of the NBA Playoffs 4–1. Despite losing four of his starters, including star forward LaMarcus Aldridge, in the off-season, Stotts's fourth season saw him lead the Trail Blazers to the second round, after defeating the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round. In the second round, Portland played the top-seeded Golden State Warriors to a very competitive five-game series, but eventually lost 4–1. On May 16, 2016, Stotts agreed on a contract extension with the Trail Blazers.[9] In the 2018–19 season, Stotts led the Trail Blazers to a 53–29 regular season record and their deepest playoff run in almost 20 years. Portland defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4–1 and Denver Nuggets 4–3 in the first two rounds but were swept by the two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors in the Conference Finals.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/288.png

""Ed"" Tapscott[1][2] (born June 11, 1953 in Washington, D.C.)[3] is the former interim head coach of the NBA's Washington Wizards. Tapscott received his bachelor's degree from Tufts University and his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from American University Washington College of Law. He was an assistant to Gary Williams at American University in the 1970s while a law student, and took over head coaching duties in 1982. By the time Tapscott left American in 1990 to finally use his J.D. as director of team sports for Advantage International (a sports marketing and management firm), he was the coach with the 2nd highest winning percentage. He subsequently led the team to one of the program's biggest victories. On December 15, 1982, in his fifth game as coach Tapscott guided the Eagles to a 62-61 upset over its cross-town rival Georgetown who were led by Patrick Ewing and ranked fifth in the nation.[4] The game is also notable because the Washington Cardiovascular Institute had given the coach a portable heart monitor to wear during the game, with his heart rate jumping from a pregame rate of 68 to 130 to 170 in the second half.[5] Tapscott almost scored another upset over a highly ranked Georgetown four years later but the Reggie Williams-led Hoyas held on 62-59 and Coach John Thompson dropped American University from its schedule thereafter.[6] An NBA executive level professional for years, Tapscott was the first employee hired to lead the Charlotte Bobcats as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, but resigned after serving as President and Chief Executive Officer in 2006. Tapscott formerly worked in the New York Knicks’ front office, including a stint as interim president and general manager. He’s perhaps best remembered in New York for the 1999 drafting of French center Frederic Weis who never played a game in the NBA, but much less credited for formulating the New York Knicks team, which culminated its season in the 1999 NBA Finals. On November 24, 2008, Tapscott, at that time director of player development, was named as interim head coach, replacing Eddie Jordan after a dismal 1–10 start during the season. General manager of the Wizards, Ernie Grunfeld, stated that Tapscott will run the team for the rest of the season.[7] Tapscott made his professional coaching debut against the Golden State Warriors on November 25, 2008, a game which resulted in a win. Under Tapscott, the Wizards accrued an 18-53 record in the 2008-2009 season.[8] After Flip Saunders was hired as coach of the Wizards, Tapscott returned to his position as the team's Director of Player Development.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/290.png
291,Jerry Tarkanian,"August 8, 1930","February 11, 2015",,Fresno State,1993,1993,1,true,,"""[2]""",/coaches/tarkaje99c.html,"Jerry Tarkanian (August 8, 1930 – February 11, 2015) was an American basketball coach. He coached college basketball for 31 seasons over five decades at three schools. He spent the majority of his career coaching with the UNLV Runnin' Rebels, leading them four times to the Final Four of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, winning the national championship in 1990. Tarkanian revolutionized the college game at UNLV, utilizing a pressing defense to fuel its fast-paced offense. Overall, he won over 700 games in his college coaching career, only twice failing to win 20 games, while never having a losing season. Tarkanian was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013. Tarkanian studied at Pasadena City College and later Fresno State, earning a bachelor's degree while playing basketball. He was a head coach at the high school level before becoming a successful junior college coach at Riverside City College winning three state championships, and returned to Pasadena City College and led them to a state championship. In 1968, he moved to a four-year college at Long Beach State College. Tarkanian established a successful program built on former junior college players, who were typically considered second-rate by other four-year programs. He was also the rare coach who dared to start a predominantly black lineup. He compiled a 122–20 record over five years at Long Beach before moving to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). He transformed the small program into a national powerhouse while granting his players the freedom to express themselves. Known for his colorful behavior and affectionately referred to as ""Tark the Shark"", Tarkanian became a celebrity in Las Vegas. He left the Runnin' Rebels for a brief stint coaching professionally with the San Antonio Spurs in the National Basketball Association (NBA) before finishing his career at his alma mater, Fresno State. Throughout his career, he battled accusations of rules violations from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), with each of his three universities suffering penalties. Tarkanian responded by challenging the organization to also investigate larger and more powerful universities.[1][2] The NCAA ordered UNLV to suspend him in 1977, but he sued the NCAA and continued coaching while the case was pending. The Supreme Court ruled against him in 1988, but he remained UNLV's coach after a settlement with the NCAA. Tarkanian sued them again in 1992, and the case was settled when he received $2.5 million in 1998. Tarkanian, the son of Armenian immigrants, was born in Euclid, Ohio in 1930.[3] His mother, Rose, was a survivor of the Armenian Genocide.[4] Tarkanian's maternal grandfather, Mickael, was an Ottoman government official who was beheaded by Turkish authorities.[5][6] Mickael's son was also decapitated by the same authorities.[5][6] Fearing for their lives, Rose and the rest of her siblings eventually escaped the Ottoman Empire and settled in Lebanon where Rose met George Tarkanian. The couple married and moved to the United States. However, Jerry's father died when he was 13.[5] By this time, Jerry showed his interest in sports, but his stepfather disapproved of his involvement with sports, while his mother encouraged him to pursue it.[7] A graduate of Pasadena High School,[8] he initially attended Pasadena City College in California and played basketball at the college in the 1950–51 season.[9] Tarkanian then transferred to Fresno State College, where he played basketball for the Bulldogs in the 1954–55 season as a backup guard.[3][10][11] After graduating from Fresno State College in 1955,[3] he earned a master's degree in educational management from the University of Redlands.[12] He began his coaching career with five years of California high school basketball, starting with San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fresno.[12][13] He then moved to Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster (1958) and Redlands High School (1959–1960).[12] He then moved on to the junior college level at Riverside City College from 1961 to 1966 and Pasadena City College from 1966 to 1968. He coached teams to a record four straight California junior college championships — three at Riverside, one at Pasadena.[12][14] Tarkanian moved to Division I basketball as coach at Long Beach State from 1968 to 1973, where he was among the first coaches to shun an unwritten rule that at least three of the five starting players had to be white. He also pioneered the use of junior college athletes.[14] University of Nevada, Reno history professor Richard O. Davies wrote in his book, The Maverick Spirit, that Tarkanian's recruiting practice drew complaints that he was running a ""'renegade' program built upon less than stellar students.""[15] When the 49ers made the 1970 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament led by All-America Ed Ratliff, Tarkanian boasted that his team consisted almost entirely of junior college transfers. Long Beach State reached four straight NCAA tournaments, and established itself as a regional power.[14] Though the schools were separated by just 30 miles (48 km),[16] John Wooden of UCLA refused to schedule a regular season game with them.[17] At the peak of Wooden's dynasty, the schools met in the 1971 West Regional final. Long Beach led at the half by 12, but UCLA prevailed 57–55 en route to their fifth straight national championship.[10][14][16] Wary of continuing in UCLA's shadow, Tarkanian accepted an offer to coach at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in 1973.[10] Prior to his arrival, UNLV was dubbed ""Tumbleweed Tech"" by locals, and their basketball program had no winning track record and minimal fan support. However, he achieved much success there, coaching the Runnin' Rebels from 1973 to 1992. In fact, it was Tarkanian's idea to call the team the ""Runnin' Rebels."" His teams were known for an up-tempo style, stifling defense, and going on long runs that turned close games into blowouts. They hit their peak after joining the Pacific Coast Athletic Association in 1982, winning or sharing 10 straight regular-season titles and winning seven tournament titles. He took his UNLV teams to four Final Fours. In the first, in 1977 (only seven years after the program joined Division I), the Rebels lost to North Carolina in the semifinals.[3] The Rebels averaged 109 points per game that season in an era before the shot clock or the three-point shot. However, Carolina controlled the tempo with coach Dean Smith's famous four corners offense.[14] Ten years later in the Final Four, UNLV was defeated by Bob Knight's Indiana Hoosiers, the eventual national champion. Finally, in the 1990 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Tarkanian led UNLV to the championship, prevailing 103–73 against Duke while setting a record for margin of victory in a championship game. That season the team was heavily monitored by the NCAA, which visited their campus 11 times, and suspended 10 players at various times.[14] The 1990–91 team appeared poised to repeat as champions after running their record to 34–0 while winning by an average margin of 27.3 points. However, a rematch against Duke in the national semifinals saw the Blue Devils prevail 79–77 after the Rebels' Anderson Hunt missed a 22-foot shot at the buzzer.[14] Tarkanian had been under more or less constant scrutiny from the NCAA for most of his career, but managed to weather the pressure until he signed Lloyd Daniels, a talented, but troubled shooting guard from New York City. In 1987—just months before he was due to come to campus—Daniels was caught buying crack cocaine from an undercover policeman. While Tarkanian had been known for taking in troubled players, this was too much even for him, and he announced shortly afterward that Daniels would never play for UNLV. Not long after Daniels' arrest, it emerged he'd been led to UNLV by Richard Perry, a prominent gambler who had been convicted twice for sports bribery.[18] Perry's involvement triggered yet another NCAA investigation, which resulted in the NCAA initially banning the Rebels from the 1991 NCAA Tournament, only months after they won the 1990 title. However, the NCAA later agreed to a compromise which deferred the sanctions until 1992, allowing UNLV to defend its title. Months after UNLV's 1991 semifinal loss to Duke, the Las Vegas Review-Journal published a picture showing three of Tarkanian's players in a hot tub with Perry. The picture had been taken in 1989, only months after Tarkanian claimed that he had warned his players to stay away from Perry. On June 7, 1991, Tarkanian announced he would resign after coaching one more season. Already banned from any postseason play, Tarkanian guided the 1991–92 team to a 26–2 season. He won his final game 65–53 over Utah State.[3][15] Tarkanian was offered the Los Angeles Lakers head coaching job in 1977, but declined, continuing to coach college basketball. Tarkanian was hired to coach the San Antonio Spurs in 1992, not long after leaving UNLV.[3] However, he disagreed with Spurs owner Red McCombs over the need for experience at point guard. During the offseason, the Spurs had lost Rod Strickland to free agency, when he signed with Portland, leaving the Spurs without a point guard with significant NBA experience. The Spurs had signed Vinny Del Negro, a combo-guard from the Italian League, to replace Strickland. They also signed NBA journeyman Avery Johnson, formerly of the Houston Rockets, to a one-year contract. Tarkanian felt that the Spurs wouldn't be competitive without an experienced point guard, but McCombs disagreed. As a result, Tarkanian was fired after only 20 games with a 9–11 record. He received a $1.3 million settlement, which he used to fund a lawsuit against the NCAA.[15] He returned to college coaching at alma mater, California State University, Fresno, from 1995–2002 and led them to six consecutive 20-win seasons. Tarkanian led the Bulldogs to five NIT tournaments and two NCAA appearances. He retired from coaching in 2002 with 778 career Division I wins. Following his retirement, Fresno State was placed on probation by the NCAA for violations committed by its men's basketball team under Tarkanian's watch.[10] The Fresno Bee reported in 2003 that some Fresno State basketball players had coursework completed for them during the years 1999 to 2001.[19] Tarkanian spent most of his career as a Division I coach in a battle with the NCAA. While at Long Beach, he wrote a newspaper column charging that the NCAA ignored improprieties at powerful schools while it pursued smaller, more defenseless institutions.[20] After he left Long Beach State, its basketball program was slapped with probation for recruiting violations which occurred under his watch.[10] Just months before the 1976–1977 season, the NCAA placed UNLV on two years' probation for ""questionable practices."" Although the alleged violations dated back to 1971—before Tarkanian became coach—the NCAA pressured UNLV into suspending Tarkanian as coach for two years. Tarkanian sued, claiming the suspension violated his right to due process. In October 1977, a Nevada judge issued an injunction that reinstated Tarkanian as coach.[15] The case eventually made it all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled in 1988 that the NCAA had the right to discipline its member schools, reversing the 1977 injunction.[21] [22] In the decade between the original suspension and the Supreme Court ruling, it was revealed that the NCAA's enforcement process was stacked heavily in the NCAA's favor — so heavily, in fact, that it created a perception that there was no due process. The enforcement staff was allowed to build cases on hearsay, and shared few of their findings with the targeted school. The resulting negative publicity led the NCAA to institute a clearer separation between the enforcement staff and the infractions committee, as well as a system for appeals. Also, hearsay evidence was no longer admissible in infractions cases.[23] After being fired from the Spurs, Tarkanian sued the NCAA, claiming it had harassed him for over two decades. The harassment, Tarkanian claimed, started when he wrote a newspaper column alleging that the NCAA was more willing to punish less-prominent schools than big-name schools. Although the NCAA did not admit harassing Tarkanian, it settled out of court in 1998, paying him $2.5 million.[15] Tarkanian was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013, an honor that fellow coaches had been saying was overdue.[2] ""Time has a way of healing things. And in this case, time worked in his favor,"" said Hall of Fame chairman Jerry Colangelo.[3] The controversy from his NCAA dealings was widely believed to have contributed to the delay.[14] ESPN wrote that Tarkanian ""helped revolutionize the way the college game was played"".[2] Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown said he ""influenced a lot of coaches"", and coach Mike Krzyzewski added that he ""taught pressure man-to-man defense as well as anyone has ever done.""[14] Upon Tarkanian's retirement, future Hall of Fame coach Jim Calhoun proclaimed him ""one of the best teachers of defense in the last 25 to 30 years of basketball.""[14] In 31 years of coaching over five decades at three Division I schools, he compiled a career record of 729–201.[2][3] At UNLV, 39 of his players were selected in the NBA draft; Larry Johnson was the first overall pick in 1991, and Armen Gilliam was No. 2 overall in 1987.[3] Tarkanian was an innovator who had his teams play a pressing defense that forced turnovers to trigger its run-and-gun offense.[3] He was one of the few early coaches to effectively use the three-point shot, which was added by the NCAA in 1986.[3][24] Tarkanian recruited players that his peers often passed over, taking chances on junior college students or those with a troubled past.[2] His players hailed predominately from urban areas, and he allowed his team the freedom to express themselves. While some of those players were high-maintenance, he was the rare coach who was able to blend multiple personalities together into a team, and they played with a unique swagger. Tarkanian's teams changed the style and image of college basketball in a way that predated the impact the Fab Five of Michigan had in the 1990s. ""He made the players more important than him. He made the players the show. It was about the players first,"" said former UNLV assistant Mark Warkentien.[25] According to Fab Five member Jalen Rose, ""We were considered rough-and-tumble at Michigan, but it started with UNLV.""[25] UNLV was transformed by Tarkanian from a small commuter college into a national powerhouse. Demand for UNLV sweatshirts grew across the nation.[2] He became a celebrity, and tickets to UNLV games became hot items with regulars, including Vegas headliners Frank Sinatra, Bill Cosby and Don Rickles.[3][26] With no professional teams in the city, the Rebels became the town's center of attention,[25][26] and their pregame ceremonies included light shows and fireworks during player introductions.[2] His success at UNLV paved the way for other successful mid-majors.[17] The floor of UNLV's home arena at the Thomas & Mack Center was named ""Jerry Tarkanian Court"" in 2005. A bronze life-size statue of Tarkanian was added outside the arena in 2013. Since 2012, Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas has held the Tarkanian Classic, a high school tournament featuring some of the top teams in the country.[3] In 2014, Fresno State retired Tarkanian's No. 2 jersey from his college playing days.[27] Tarkanian also has a middle school located in Southern Highlands, NV named after him and his wife Lois. He had small roles in the 1979 film, The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh as the LA Team Coach, in the 1992 film, Honeymoon in Vegas as a poker player, and in the 1994 film, Blue Chips as a basketball coach. Jerry Tarkanian was married to Las Vegas city councilwoman Lois Tarkanian. They had four children and ten grandchildren. One of their sons, Danny Tarkanian, was an All-American Honorable Mention college basketball player while playing for Jerry Tarkanian at UNLV.[28] He won the Republican nomination for Nevada secretary of state in the 2006 primary but lost in the general election. In 2010, he mounted an unsuccessful Republican primary campaign for the United States Senate seat held by Harry Reid. Tarkanian was a good friend of college basketball coach Bob Knight. Tarkanian and Knight matched wits in the national semifinals of the 1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in New Orleans, with Knight's Indiana Hoosiers defeating UNLV, 97–93. He also started a basketball school in Las Vegas, named The Tarkanian Basketball Academy. His granddaughter Dannielle Diamant played for Northwestern University women's basketball team.[29][30] On February 11, 2015, Tarkanian died at the age of 84 at Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas, where he had been hospitalized days earlier after difficulty breathing.[3] The city of Las Vegas that day lowered its flags at City Hall to half-staff in tribute to him.[2] As a memorial tribute, the casinos along the Las Vegas Strip dimmed their lights for roughly three minutes in Tarkanian's honor on February 18.[31] Note: The record of 784–202 includes six NCAA tournament games vacated by the NCAA while at Long Beach State and 49 games vacated while at Fresno State. Excluding these games, the record would be 729–201.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/291.png
292,Reggie Theus,"October 13, 1957",,"Inglewood in Inglewood, California",UNLV,2008,2009,2,true,,"""[2]""",/coaches/theusre01c.html,"Reginald Wayne Theus (born October 13, 1957) is an American retired basketball player and the former head coach of California State University, Northridge.[1] He formerly served as head coach for the NBA's Sacramento Kings and New Mexico State University's men's basketball team. He was also an assistant coach for the University of Louisville under Rick Pitino. Theus was one of four children of Felix and Willie Mae Theus. His parents divorced when he was four. His father had a janitorial business and died before Reggie's senior year in high school. For a brief period, Reggie ran his father's business after his death.[2] Theus attended Inglewood High School in Inglewood, California. Growing up, he also attended Monroe Middle School in Inglewood. As a senior at Inglewood, Theus averaged 28.6 points and 15.5 rebounds per game.[3] Theus played college basketball at UNLV for head coach Jerry Tarkanian from 1976 to 1978. In three seasons with the Runnin' Rebels, Theus averaged 12.9 points, 4.4 assists and 4.3 rebounds per game. Theus, who became one of the best players to ever don a UNLV uniform, shot 81 percent from the free-throw line for his career while amassing 1,177 career points (21st on all-time scoring list), 401 career assists and 389 career rebounds in just 91 collegiate games.[4] As a sophomore, Theus helped lead UNLV into the national spotlight as the Rebels went 29–3, advancing to the school's first Final Four in Atlanta. Despite losing by a single point to University of North Carolina in the semifinals, UNLV defeated UNC-Charlotte in the third-place game and set NCAA single-season records for most points in a season (3,426), most 100-point games (23) and most consecutive 100-point games (12). He averaged 14.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game while shooting 81.8 percent from the charity stripe and 49.7 percent from the field as a sophomore. As a junior, Reggie was named a second team All-American after averaging 18.9 points, 6.8 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game.[4] In 1989, Theus was inducted into the UNLV Athletic Hall of Fame and in 1997 he became one of only eight players in school history to have his jersey retired by the Rebels.[5] After attending UNLV and having a successful college career, Theus was selected by the Chicago Bulls with the 9th pick of the 1978 NBA draft. A 6'7"" guard, Theus averaged 16.3 points per game during his first season and was the runner-up for the 1979 NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He was second on the team in scoring behind Artis Gilmore, a future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee. Paired in the backcourt with fellow UNLV alumnus Ricky Sobers, Theus followed his rookie campaign with a sophomore season in which he averaged 20.2 points and 6.3 assists for the 1979-1980 Bulls.[6] He garnered the nickname ""Rush Street Reggie"" while playing in Chicago for owning an apartment on that street and having an active social life around that area, being frequently spotted at the city night spots.[7] In 1981, Theus appeared in his first All-Star Game as the Bulls were 45-37 and made the 1981 NBA Playoffs . The Bulls won their first round series, defeating the New York Knicks 2 games to 0, with Theus scoring 37 points with 11 assists in the 115-114 Bulls win in the final game.[8] The Bulls faced the Boston Celtics in the next round and were swept 4-0 as the Celtics went on to win the NBA Championship. Theus was the leading scorer in game 3 with 26 points, and he averaged 19.8 points and 6.3 assists over the six playoff games.[9] In 1982-1983, Theus averaged a career high 23.8 points per game as the Bulls leading scorer, but the Bulls finished 28-54 .[6][10] Newly hired Bulls coach Kevin Loughery decided to bench Theus for the first half of the 1983–1984 season.[11] On February 14, 1984, Theus was traded to the Kansas City Kings for Steve Johnson and three second round draft picks, a move that saddened many Chicago fans who enjoyed Theus' enthusiasm and energy. The Bulls finished 27-55.[12][11] Theus played for five coaches in five and a half seasons in Chicago: Jerry Sloan (1979-1982), Phil Johnson (1982), Rod Thorn (1982), Paul Westhead (1982-1983), and Kevin Loughery (1983-1984) .[7][13] Theus averaged 18.8 points and 5.6 assists in 441 games in Chicago.[6] Theus continued his impressive play with the Kansas City Kings and Kansas City won 12 of their first 17 games after Theus joined the team.[14] He averaged 16.4 points and 8.0 assists in 30 games with the Kings, as the Kings qualified for the playoffs under Coach Phil Johnson, who had coached Theus in Chicago in 1982,.[15] In the 1984–85 season, the Kings moved to Sacramento, California. In the 1985–86 season, Theus averaged 18.3 points and a career high 9.6 assists as the Kings made the playoffs again, losing to the Hakeem Olajuwon and Ralph Sampson and the Houston Rockets 3–0 in the first round, as Theus averaged 15.0 points and 6.3 assists in the series.[16] Over his four seasons with the Kings, Theus became a key scorer and distributor, averaging 18.8 points and 8.1 assists in 346 games with the Kings.[6] On June 27, 1988, Theus was traded by the Kings to the Atlanta Hawks with a third round pick for Randy Wittman and a first round pick.[6] He averaged 15.8 points and 4.7 assists for the Hawks in 1988–89, playing in the backcourt with Doc Rivers and alongside Hall of Famers Dominique Wilkins and Moses Malone. Theus helped the Hawks go 52-30 and advance to the playoffs.[17] On June 15, 1989, the expansion Orlando Magic, picked him from the Hawks in the expansion draft. Not surprisingly, the expansion Magic struggled, finishing 18-64. Theus averaged 18.9 points and 5.4 assists with the Magic.[18][17] The New Jersey Nets traded a second round pick to acquire Theus on June 25, 1990. In 1990-1991 he averaged a team-leading 18.6 points along with 4.7 assists for the 26-56 Nets. Theus' NBA career ended after his Nets season.[19] Theus had career totals of 19,015 points and 6,453 assists, averaging 18.5 and 6.3 in 1026 NBA games. He played one season in Italy for Ranger Varese before retiring from basketball altogether in 1992. He also played along with Aris in the Greek Cup Final in 1993.[6] In that game he scored 9 points. Theus is one of only two players in league history listed at 6 ft 6 or taller to tally more than 750 assists in an NBA season (788 in 1985–86), the other player is NBA legend Magic Johnson.[20] In 2005, Reggie Theus was hired by the New Mexico State Aggies as the head coach of the men's basketball team after the retirement of head coach Lou Henson. In his first season, Theus turned the Aggies from a 6–24 squad in 2004–05 to a 16–14 team in the 2005–06 season – matching the fifth best turn-around for a Division-I men's basketball team. In his second year as head coach, Theus led NMSU to their 17th NCAA tournament, their first tournament appearance since 1999, and coached NMSU to its 14th conference tournament title which earned them an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament. On June 19, 2007, Theus was hired by the Maloof brothers and guaranteed three years as head coach of the Sacramento Kings. He noted his hiring as coach had brought his career to ""full circle"", as he once played in the NBA with the Kings. Marvin Menzies succeeded him as head coach at New Mexico State. On December 15, 2008, Theus was fired by the Kings and the team announced that their assistant coach Kenny Natt would lead the team in the interim period. Theus was an assistant coach with the Minnesota Timberwolves under head coach Kurt Rambis from 2009 to 2011.[21] In April 2010 Theus was interviewed by DePaul University for its head coaching position.[22] He became the head coach of the Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA D-League in October 2012.[1][23] Theus was named the head coach of California State University Northridge in 2013. In his first season with the Matadors he led them to a 17-18 record, but managed to reach the Big West Conference Finals where they lost to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. On March 6, 2018 Cal State Northridge parted ways with Theus after a 44-107 record.[24] Theus hosted various talk shows in Sacramento, Orlando and Atlanta. For several years Theus served as a studio analyst for Turner Sports and the Los Angeles Lakers. Theus was one of the original panelists on The Best Damn Sports Show Period. Theus portrayed a high school basketball coach named Bill Fuller in the TNBC Saturday morning sitcom Hang Time from 1995 to 1997.[27] Theus did in-game color commentary and was the pre-game co-host for ""SlamBall"" for the 2002 season. Theus provided the commentary for the video game NBA Live 2000 Theus made cameos in the films Book of Love, Forget Paris and Like Mike.[27] Theus called Pac-12 basketball with Barry Tompkins on Fox Sports Net. Theus is married to Elaine. They have three children: Raquel, Reggie and Rhyan.[28]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/292.png
293,Tom Thibodeau,"January 17, 1958",,,Salem State University,2011,2019,8,true,,"""[5, 1]""",/coaches/thiboto99c.html,"Thomas Joseph Thibodeau Jr. (/ˈθɪbədoʊ/ THIB-ə-doh;[1][2] born January 17, 1958) is an American basketball coach who most recently was head coach and president of basketball operations of the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA).[3] Since June 2013, he has served as an assistant coach for the United States men's national basketball team. As a defensive coach, he helped the Houston Rockets rank among the Top 5 in the league in scoring defense and field goal percentage defense from 2004 to 2007,[4] and he has helped his team finish in the league's Top 10 in team defense 15 times.[5] He coached in 87 playoff games and was part of the 1999 NBA Finals as an assistant coach with the New York Knicks before joining the Boston Celtics, with whom he won the 2008 NBA Finals as well as helping guide them back to the 2010 NBA Finals, serving as a defensive coach. In 2011, he was named the NBA Coach of the Year after leading the Bulls to a 62-win season. Thibodeau played basketball at Salem State College, serving as captain during the 1980-81 season. During his time with the Vikings, the six-foot-two-inch Thibodeau helped Salem State to consecutive Division III national tournaments (1980–81). In 1980, Thibodeau helped Salem State to the league championship and the school's first NCAA Tournament bid. Upon graduating, he became an assistant coach at the school in 1981. In 1984, at age 25, he became head coach at Salem State after serving three years as an assistant. One season later he became an assistant coach at Harvard University, where he spent the next four seasons. While coaching in college, Thibodeau attended coaching clinics and visited the practices of many of the top coaches in the U.S., including Hall of Fame coaches Bobby Knight, Rick Pitino, Hubie Brown, Gary Williams, Morgan Wootten, and Jim Calhoun.[6] In 1987, Thibodeau befriended Bill Musselman, a former head coach in the NBA, ABA and NCAA who was coaching the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Association. According to the New York Times, ""the Patroons’ practices, the attention to detail, the efficiency, the sheer number of offensive sets, fed into Thibodeau's addiction.""[7] After four years at Harvard, he entered the NBA in 1989, as an assistant coach with an expansion team, the Minnesota Timberwolves, who had hired Bill Musselman as the team's first head coach. Prior to the 1991–92 season, he joined the Seattle SuperSonics as an advance scout. Thibodeau moved to the San Antonio Spurs the following season, where he worked as an assistant coach to Jerry Tarkanian, Rex Hughes and John Lucas for two seasons. After the 1993–94 season, he left the Spurs along with Lucas to become an assistant under Lucas with the Philadelphia 76ers. After the 1995–96 season, he again left simultaneously with Lucas, this time joining the New York Knicks as an assistant to head coach Jeff Van Gundy. During his tenure with the Knicks, he helped the team set a then-NBA record by holding 33 consecutive opponents under 100 points in the 2000–01 season. As part of the Knicks coaching staff, he also helped Van Gundy to coach the Eastern Conference All-Stars in the 2000 All-Star Game. He spent seven years with the Knicks before joining the Houston Rockets prior to the 2003–04 season, where again he was an assistant to head coach Van Gundy, who has described Thibodeau as ""brilliant"".[7] On August 30, 2007, Thibodeau was named associate head coach of the Boston Celtics,[8][9][10] who hoped his hiring would bolster their defense.[11] Eventually, he helped the Celtics become the best defensive team in the league.[12] On November 4, 2007, Thibodeau took over head coaching duties against the Toronto Raptors in place of Doc Rivers, who was unable to coach due to the death of his father earlier that day.[13] During the 2008 playoffs, Thibodeau was rumored to be a candidate for the vacant head coaching job with the New York Knicks, for whom he had worked as an assistant coach for seven years, as well as the Chicago Bulls,[14][15] but he was not hired by either. Thibodeau led the Celtics to the best rating in several defensive categories in 2007–08,[5] and was a key factor in containing Kobe Bryant during the 2008 Finals.[16] On June 2, 2010, Thibodeau interviewed with officials from the Chicago Bulls for their vacant head coach position.[17] On June 23, he was confirmed as the Bulls' head coach. Thibodeau was named the NBA Coach of the Year on May 1, 2011, after tying the record for most wins by a rookie head coach with 62. He also led the Bulls to their first 50-win season and first division title since the Michael Jordan era.[18] The Bulls lost the Eastern Conference Finals to the Miami Heat. On February 14, 2012, Thibodeau clinched the position of Eastern Conference All-Star Coach for the All-Star Game in Orlando. At the time, the Bulls were first in the Eastern Conference.[citation needed] With a win over the Orlando Magic on March 19, 2012, Thibodeau became the fastest coach in NBA history to earn 100 career victories. He accomplished this in 130 games, one game fewer than the record set previously by Avery Johnson in 2006.[19] Thibodeau and the Bulls were the East's top seed entering the playoffs and also had the league's best regular-season record and home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.[20] In Game 1 of the Bulls' first-round series against the Philadelphia 76ers, point guard Derrick Rose tore his ACL.[21] Thibodeau defended his decision to keep Rose in the game with 1 minute, 22 seconds remaining in the game and the Bulls leading by 12 points.[22] Commenting on Thibodeau's decision, Bulls general manager Gar Forman stated, ""There is absolutely no issue there. It's a playoff game. They had cut a lead down (from 20) to 12. We're going to have our guys on the floor making sure we win the game. Tom is a terrific coach who does a lot of things well. One of the best things he does is pace our team.""[23] Thibodeau finished second to Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs in 2012 NBA Coach of the Year voting. The Bulls' season was cut short after a 4–2 defeat by the 76ers.[24] Rose missed the entire 2012–13 season, but despite his absence, the Bulls finished 45-37, second in the Central Division (behind the Indiana Pacers) and 5th in their conference. They defeated the Brooklyn Nets 4-3 (after leading 3-1) in the first round of the playoffs and lost to the Miami Heat 4–1 in the next round. On May 13, 2013, Thibodeau was fined $35,000 for criticizing the referees during the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Miami Heat.[25] Thibodeau finished third in 2014 NBA Coach of the Year voting. He led the second year straight Derrick Rose-less Bulls to the fourth-best record in the Eastern Conference. The Bulls' season ended with a 4-1 series loss to the fifth-seeded Washington Wizards.[26] Tension between the Bulls' front office and Thibodeau grew considerably over the 2014-15 season, which ended in a six-game series loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Shortly thereafter, on May 28, 2015, the Bulls fired Thibodeau.[27] On April 20, 2016, it was announced that the Minnesota Timberwolves had hired Thibodeau as head coach and president of basketball operations.[3] The Timberwolves had spent the better part of a decade in the NBA wilderness, having not made the playoffs since 2004. In his second season, the Timberwolves made their first playoff appearance in 14 years.[28] The Timberwolves fired Thibodeau from his positions as head coach and president of basketball operations on January 6, 2019.[29] He has been called ""one of the best coaches in the NBA"",[31] sometimes ranking among the top five coaches in the league among NBA general managers.[32] He was ranked 13th best coach in 2017 by ESPN, despite the Timberwolves finishing with a bottom six record.[33] Highly regarded as a defensive strategist, in January 2013, ESPN praised Thibodeau's defensive system as ""the pinnacle of team defensive strategy in the NBA.""[34] However, according to a 2010 Boston Globe article, ""one of the many misconceptions about Thibodeau is that he’s strictly a defensive specialist."" Jeff Van Gundy hired Thibodeau because he was drawn to ""his innovative offensive sets"" and ""player development skills.""[35] Thibodeau has been described as a ""no-nonsense coach, but his personal authenticity and the success of his strategies endear him to his players.""[34] According to Kevin Garnett, who played for Thibodeau in Boston, Thibodeau is ""a worker. He's a guy that loves his job. He does it with passion.""[36] In 2005, while an assistant with the Houston Rockets, Thibodeau began working with Yao Ming, traveling to China to hone Yao's skills.[37] According to Jon Barry, a former NBA player who worked as an assistant with the Rockets, ""Thibodeau was an effective one-on-one teacher [who spent] countless hours ... working with Yao Ming on his footwork....""[38] During the 2004–05 season, Yao averaged 18.3 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. The following season, after working with Thibodeau, Yao averaged 22.3 points and 10.2 rebounds. A number of Thibodeau's former players have praised him for his ability to develop their talent. According to Joakim Noah, who played for Thibodeau with the Bulls, ""I feel like I really improved as a player because of him.""[39] Thibodeau has been criticized for playing his starters too many minutes, resulting in them becoming worn down and/or injured over the course of the season.[40][41] A native of New Britain, Connecticut, Thibodeau was born to Thomas J. Thibodeau Sr., and Ann M. (Montanile) Thibodeau and has four siblings (two brothers and two sisters).[42] He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Science in counseling from Salem State University. In 1998, he was inducted into the New Britain Sports Hall of Fame. Thibodeau has never been married.[43] According to a 2012 New York Times article, Thibodeau was engaged while he was in graduate school at Salem State, but called it off a month or two before the wedding.[7]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/293.png
294,Isiah Thomas,"April 30, 1961",,"St. Joseph in Westchester, Illinois",Indiana,2001,2008,5,true,,"""[1, 2]""",/coaches/thomais01c.html,"Isiah Lord Thomas III (born April 30, 1961) is an American former basketball player who played professionally for the Detroit Pistons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). A point guard, the 12-time NBA All-Star was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Thomas has also been a professional and collegiate head coach, a basketball executive, and a broadcaster. Thomas played collegiately for the Indiana Hoosiers, leading them to the 1981 NCAA championship as a sophomore and declaring for the NBA draft. He was taken as the second overall pick by the Pistons in the 1981 NBA draft, and played for them his entire career, while leading the ""Bad Boys"" to the 1988–89 and 1989–90 NBA championships. After his playing career, he was an executive with the Toronto Raptors, a television commentator, an executive with the Continental Basketball Association, head coach of the Indiana Pacers, and an executive and head coach for the New York Knicks. He was later the men's basketball coach for the Florida International University (FIU) Golden Panthers for three seasons from 2009 to 2012. In early May 2015, amidst controversy, Thomas was named president and part owner of the Knicks' WNBA sister team, the New York Liberty, subsequent to the re-hiring of Thomas's former Pistons teammate, Bill Laimbeer, as the team's coach.[1][2][3] The youngest of nine children, Thomas was born on April 30, 1961 in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in the city's West Side. He started playing basketball at age three and would dribble and shoot baskets as the halftime entertainment at Catholic Youth Organization games.[4] He attended Our Lady of Sorrows School and St. Joseph High School in Westchester, which was a 90-minute commute from his home.[5][6] Playing under coach Gene Pingatore, he led St. Joseph to the state finals in his junior year, and was considered one of the top college prospects in the country.[7] Thomas was recruited to play college basketball for Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers. Although he received mail saying Knight tied up his players and beat them, he did not believe the rumors.[7] When Knight visited the Thomas home, one of Isiah's brothers, who wanted him to attend DePaul, embarrassed him by insulting the Indiana coach and engaging him in a shouting match. Nevertheless, Thomas chose Knight and Indiana because he felt that getting away to Bloomington would be good for him, as would Knight's discipline.[7] Thomas quickly had to adjust to Knight's disciplinarian style. At the 1979 Pan American Games in Puerto Rico, Knight got so mad at Thomas he threatened to put him on a plane home. Knight recalled yelling at the freshman-to-be, ""You ought to go to DePaul, Isiah, because you sure as hell aren't going to be an Indiana player playing like that.""[7] Prior to the start of his freshman year, the 1979–80 season, Knight became so upset with Thomas that he kicked him out of a practice. According to Thomas, Knight was making a point that no player, no ""matter how talented, is bigger than Knight's philosophy.""[7] Thomas quickly proved his skills as a player and became a favorite with both Knight and Indiana fans. His superior abilities eventually caused Knight to adjust his coaching style.[7] Fans displayed bedsheets with quotations from the Book of Isaiah (""And a little child shall lead them"") and nicknamed him ""Mr. Wonderful.""[7] Because of Thomas's relatively short stature at 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m), coach Knight would call him ""Pee Wee"".[7] Thomas and Mike Woodson led the Hoosiers to the Big Ten championship and advanced to the 1980 Sweet Sixteen. The next year, the 1980–81 season, Knight made Thomas captain and told him to run the show on the floor.[7] Thomas responded so well that, as the season unfolded, Knight and Thomas grew as friends. When a Purdue player took a cheap shot at Thomas during a game at Bloomington, Knight called a press conference to defend his star. And 19 days later, when Thomas hit an Iowa player and was ejected from a game, Knight refused to criticize him.[7] That year, Thomas and the Hoosiers once again won a conference title and won the 1981 NCAA tournament, the school's fourth national title.[8] The sophomore earned the tournament's Most Outstanding Player award, and made himself eligible for the upcoming NBA draft.[8][9] In the 1981 NBA draft, the Detroit Pistons chose Thomas with the No. 2 pick and signed him to a four-year $1.6 million contract.[10] Thomas made the All-Rookie team and started for the Eastern Conference in the 1982 NBA All-Star Game. In the opening round of the 1984 NBA Playoffs, Thomas and the Pistons faced off against Bernard King and the New York Knicks. In the pivotal fifth game, Thomas was having a subpar performance, while King was having an excellent game. Thomas scored 16 points in the last 94 seconds to force the game into overtime, but then fouled out, and the Knicks held on to win. In the 1985 NBA Playoffs, Thomas and his team went to the conference semifinals against the 15-time NBA champion Boston Celtics led by future basketball Hall of Famers Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, and Dennis Johnson. Detroit couldn't shake the Celtics in their six-game series, eventually losing. In the 1987 NBA Playoffs, Thomas and the Pistons went to the Eastern Conference Finals and faced the Celtics again. It was the furthest the team had advanced since moving from Fort Wayne. Detroit was able to tie the Celtics at two games apiece, but its hope of winning Game 5 at Boston Garden was dashed by Larry Bird with just seconds remaining: Thomas attempted to quickly inbound the ball, Bird stole the pass and hit Dennis Johnson for the game-winning layup. In 1988, the Pistons' first trip to the Finals saw them face the Los Angeles Lakers, led by Magic Johnson, James Worthy, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Before the series, Thomas and Johnson exchanged a courtside kiss on the cheek prior to tip-off as a sign of their deep friendship.[11][12] After taking a 3–2 series lead back to Los Angeles, Detroit appeared poised to win their first NBA title in Game 6. One of Thomas's most inspiring and self-defining moments came in Game 6. Although he had severely sprained his ankle late in the game, Thomas continued to play. While hobbling and in obvious pain, Thomas scored 25 points in a single quarter, an NBA Finals record. But the Lakers won the game 103–102 on a pair of last-minute free throws by Abdul-Jabbar, following a controversial foul called on Bill Laimbeer. With Thomas unable to compete at full strength the Lakers were able to take advantage and clinched their second consecutive title in Game 7, 108–105. In the 1988–89 season, Thomas, along with teammates Joe Dumars, Rick Mahorn, Vinnie Johnson, Dennis Rodman, James Edwards, John Salley, Bill Laimbeer, and Mark Aguirre, guided his team to a 63–19 record. Detroit played a brash and dominating brand of basketball through the playoffs that led to their nickname ""Bad Boys"". First they defeated Boston, which had been suffering persistent injuries. Michael Jordan and the up-and-coming Chicago Bulls fell next in the Conference Finals, setting up an NBA Finals rematch with the Lakers. This time the Pistons dominated, sweeping the Lakers in 4 games to win their first of back-to-back championships. The following year, Thomas was voted NBA Finals Most Valuable Player of the 1990 NBA Finals after averaging 27.6 points per game, 7.0 assists per game, and 5.2 rebounds per game in Detroit's victory over Clyde Drexler's Portland Trail Blazers. The Pistons continued to play well between 1991 and 1993 but found their road back to the NBA Finals blocked by the emerging Chicago Bulls dynasty. An aging and ailing Thomas decided to end his career following the 1994 season, but a torn Achilles' tendon in April forced him off the court for good a month early. As a point guard, Thomas was a dangerous scorer and effective leader. He was known for his dribbling ability, prowess driving to the basket, and often spectacular passing. Thomas was named to the All-NBA First team three times and is the Pistons' all-time leader in points, steals, games played and assists. He ranks ninth in NBA history in assists (9,061) and 15th in steals (1,861). His No. 11 was retired by the Pistons. Thomas was selected to the 1980 Olympic team, but like all American athletes he was not able to play in Moscow due to the Olympics boycott. The boycotting countries instead participated in the ""Gold Medal Series"", a series of games against NBA teams, a French team and the 1976 Olympic gold medal team in various U.S. cities, recording a 5–1 record (losing only to the Seattle SuperSonics). Thomas shot 22–55 from the field and 14–17 from the line. He led the U.S. in assists with 37 (the next highest total on the team was 17) and averaged 9.7 points per game.[13] In 2007 Thomas received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes.[14] Despite his talent, Thomas was left off the original Olympic Dream Team, possibly as a result of an alleged feud with Michael Jordan.[15] In the book When the Game Was Ours, Magic Johnson relates that he, Jordan and other players conspired to keep Thomas off the Dream Team.[11][16] After Tim Hardaway left the team due to injury, Thomas was named to Dream Team II for the 1994 World Championship of Basketball, but did not play due to his Achilles tendon injury that eventually led to his retirement.[15] He was replaced by Kevin Johnson. Isiah Thomas is the founding Chairman and CEO of Isiah International LLC, a holding company with a diverse portfolio of business ventures and investments. Gre3n Waste Removal, Re3 Recycling, and Eleven Capital Group are three of the primary businesses in the Isiah International family of companies. The mission of Isiah International is to become a business incubator for the minority community.[17] In addition to these business ventures, Thomas is involved in real estate projects in Chicago and the surrounding region as the owner of Isiah Real Estate.[18] Thomas said he is putting money in distressed areas and reinvesting: ""I'm hoping I can be a catalyst for change in those areas, to get the population back into those communities and be a catalyst to make a difference.""[19] Thomas is also involved in a $300 million development deal for a mixed-use complex at the Illinois Medical District Commission. Isiah Real Estate partnered with Higgins Development Partners, Thomas Samuels Enterprises, and East Lake Management & Development to develop 9.5 acres (3.8 ha) of land that would include retail space, a hotel, apartments and parking areas.[18] Thomas's business career began during his career with the Pistons. Planning for life after the NBA, Thomas invested in a host of ventures through his private investment company out of Michigan, Isiah Investments, LLC. His primary investment was a large chain of printing franchises, American Speedy Printing Centers Inc. Thomas took a very hands-on approach at American Speedy, helping lead the company out of bankruptcy to become profitable and one of the largest printing franchises in the world.[20] He was also one of the founding members of the advisory board for Marquis Jet Partners and a partner of Dale and Thomas Popcorn.[21] In April 1999 Thomas became the first African American[22] elected to the Board of Governors of the Chicago Stock Exchange. He served until 2002.[23] Thomas often speaks to students and professionals around the country about his business experiences.[24][25] After retiring, Thomas became part owner and Executive Vice President for the expansion Toronto Raptors in 1994. In 1998, he left the organization after a dispute with new management over the franchise's direction and his future responsibilities.[26] During his four-year tenure with the team, the Raptors drafted Damon Stoudamire, Marcus Camby, and high schooler Tracy McGrady. After leaving the Raptors, Thomas became a television commentator (first as the lead game analyst with play-by-play man Bob Costas and then as part of the studio team) for the NBA on NBC. He also worked a three-man booth with Costas and Doug Collins. Thomas became the owner of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) from 1998 to 2000. He founded Enlighten Sports Inc, a full-service web development group specializing in sports marketing, in 1999.[27] When at the Continental Basketball Association, Thomas launched partnerships with Enlighten Sports and the University of Colorado and the CBA. The new websites allowed fans to watch live game webcasts, use live shot charts, chat with players and more. Thomas said the internet was ""and integral part of [the CBA's] strategy to provide engaging and entertaining content for fans."" [28] Thomas also launched a partnership between the CBA and SEASONTICKET.com to bring personalized video highlights and scores to fans across the country as well as be a portal for All-Star League voting. Thomas foresaw that streaming video would be the future of news and entertainment.[29] In 1998, Thomas founded Isiah.com, a company serving consumers, retailers, and corporations with online gift certificates and other i-commerce products. Isiah.com's first venture was i-gift, a one-stop, online shopping service center for gift certificates. i-gift was praised as unique because it could drive e-commerce while supporting and expanding brick-and-mortar merchants. He brought the next generation of gift certificates to The Somerset Collection in Michigan, which houses exclusive department stores and retailers. Isiah.com's mission was to ""harness internet technologies and leverage business transformation processes to create new business ventures that both produce profits and benefit under-served sectors of the community.""[30] Isiah.com also had a partnership with the NBA store.[31] Thomas purchased the CBA for $10 million, and in 2001 the league was forced into bankruptcy and folded, shortly after NBA Commissioner David Stern decided to create his own development league, the NBDL, to replace the CBA.[32] From 2000 to 2003, Thomas coached the Indiana Pacers, succeeding Larry Bird, who previously coached the Pacers to the Eastern Conference title. Thomas attempted to bring up young talents such as Jermaine O'Neal, Jamaal Tinsley, Al Harrington, and Jeff Foster. But under Thomas the Pacers were not able to stay at the elite level as they went through the transition from a veteran-dominated, playoff-experienced team to a younger, less experienced team. In Thomas's first two seasons with the Pacers, the team was eliminated in the first round by the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Nets, both of whom eventually made the NBA Finals. In his last year with the Pacers, Thomas guided them to a 48–34 record in the regular season and coached the Eastern Conference team at the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. As the third seed, the Pacers were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the sixth-seeded Boston Celtics. With blossoming talents such as Jermaine O'Neal, Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Al Harrington and Jamaal Tinsley, along with the veteran leadership of Reggie Miller, some perceived Thomas's lack of coaching experience as the Pacers' stumbling block. In the off-season, Bird returned to the Pacers as President of Basketball Operations, and his first act was to replace Thomas with Rick Carlisle. In 2000, Thomas was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Two years prior, Thomas was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.[33] On December 22, 2003, the New York Knicks hired Thomas as President of Basketball Operations.[34] Thomas was ultimately unsuccessful with the Knicks roster and fanbase. At the end of the 2005–06 season, the Knicks had the highest payroll in the league and the second-worst record. He traded away several future draft picks to Chicago in a deal for Eddy Curry including what turned out to be two lottery picks in talent-rich drafts, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Joakim Noah. On June 22, 2006, the Knicks fired coach Larry Brown, and owner James Dolan replaced him with Thomas on the condition that he show ""evident progress"" or be fired. During the following season the Knicks became embroiled in a brawl with the Denver Nuggets that Thomas allegedly instigated by ordering his players to commit a hard foul in the paint.[35] He was not fined or suspended; NBA Commissioner David Stern said that he relied only on ""definitive information"" when handing out punishments.[36] Later in the season, nine months after Dolan had demanded ""evident progress"", the Knicks re-signed Thomas to an undisclosed ""multi-year"" contract.[37] After Thomas was granted the extension, the Knicks abruptly fell from playoff contention with a dismal finish to the season. During the 2007 draft, Thomas made another trade, acquiring Zach Randolph, Fred Jones, and Dan Dickau from the Portland Trail Blazers for Steve Francis and Channing Frye. Thomas also compounded the Knicks' salary-cap problems by signing fringe players such as Jerome James and Jared Jeffries to full mid-level exception contracts. Neither player saw any significant playing time and both were often injured and highly ineffective when able to play. Despite the constant criticism he received from Knicks fans, Thomas maintained that he had no intention of leaving until he turned the team around, and predicted he would lead the Knicks to a championship, stating that his goal was to leave behind a ""championship legacy"" with the Knicks, just as he had done for the Detroit Pistons. This prediction was met with widespread skepticism.[38] On April 2, 2008, Donnie Walsh was introduced to replace Thomas as President of Basketball Operations for the Knicks. Walsh did not comment definitively on whether Thomas would be retained in any capacity. One night after the Knicks tied a franchise record of 59 losses and ended their season, news broke that in talks with Walsh the week before, Thomas had been told he would not return as Knicks head coach the following season. He was officially ""reassigned"" on April 18 ""after a season of listless and dreadful basketball, a tawdry lawsuit and unending chants from fans demanding his dismissal.""[39] Thomas posted an overall winning percentage of .341 as head coach of the Knicks, fifth lowest in team history. As part of the reassignment agreement, Thomas was to serve as a consultant to the team, reporting directly to Walsh and banned from having contact with Knicks players on the rationale that he could undermine the new head coach.[40] On April 14, 2009, Thomas accepted an offer to become the head basketball coach of FIU, replacing Sergio Rouco after five losing seasons.[41] Thomas announced that he would donate his first year's salary back to the school,[41] saying, ""I did not come here for the money.""[41] After posting a 7–25 record in his first season at FIU, on August 6, 2010, Thomas announced that he was taking a job as consultant to the New York Knicks, while keeping his position as head coach at FIU.[42] According to the New York Daily News, ""nearly every major media outlet panned the announcement of Thomas' hire"", and it led to a ""public outcry"" among fans.[43] In a reversal on August 11, Thomas announced that he would not be working with the Knicks because holding both jobs violated NBA bylaws.[43] Thomas finished his second season at FIU with an 11–19 record (5–11 in conference games). On April 6, 2012, FIU fired Thomas after he went 26–65 in three seasons. Under Thomas, FIU never won more than 11 games in a season.[44] On December 19, 2012, NBA TV announced that Thomas would begin work on December 21, 2012, as a member of the studio analyst panel.[45] It was also announced that Thomas would become a regular contributor for NBA.com.[46] On May 5, 2015, the WNBA New York Liberty hired Thomas as Team President, overseeing all of the franchise's business and basketball operations.[47] On June 22, 2015, the Liberty and the WNBA agreed to suspend consideration of Thomas's ownership application. He remains president of the team.[48] Under Thomas's leadership as team president and his former Pistons teammate Bill Laimbeer as head coach, the Liberty finished first in the Eastern Conference during the 2015 season.[49] In 2016, Thomas announced that he was the exclusive United States importer of the Cheurlin Champagne[50] brand through ISIAH Imports, a subsidiary of ISIAH International, LLC.[51] Cheurlin Champagne made its debut in the United States at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Other activations have included a private luncheon honoring former President Bill Clinton. Cheurlin recently debuted at The Palace of Auburn Hills for the final season of the Detroit Pistons at the historic arena.[52] Cheurlin produces two champagne categories: Cheurlin's Brut Speciale and Rose de Saignee and Cheurlin Thomas' ""Celebrite"" Blanc de Blanc and ""Le Champion"" Blanc de Noir. In August 2017, Thomas brought his Cheurlin Flagship Collection portfolio of Champagnes to the Bellagio in Las Vegas.[53] Since 2017, Thomas has been a regular panelist during NBA on TNT's Monday coverage Players Only, which features only former NBA players as studio analysts, play by play announcers, and color analysts for games.[54] Thomas finished his college degree at Indiana University during the Pistons' off-seasons and received his Master's in Education from the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Education in 2013.[55][56] At UC Berkeley, Thomas studied the connection between education and sports, specifically how American society makes education accessible (or inaccessible) to black male college athletes.[57] During his playing career, Thomas paid college tuition for more than 75 youngsters.[58] When he was a Piston, in 1987 Thomas organized the ""No Crime Day"" in Detroit. He even had the help of Detroit Mayor Coleman Young to call for a moratorium on crime in the summer of 1986.[59] Also in 1987 Thomas posed for a poster sponsored by the American Library Association with the caption ""READ: Isiah Thomas for America's Libraries"". Thomas is shown dressed in a Sam Spade type outfit while reading a detective novel. Thomas founded Mary's Court, a foundation that supports economically disadvantaged parents and children in the communities of Garfield Park and Lawndale on the West Side of Chicago. The charity is named for Thomas's mother, who he credits with instilling in him the importance of hard work and giving back to the community. Mary's Court has teamed up with another Chicago-based charity, Kids off the Block, to serve meals to Chicago children and families during Thanksgiving.[60] While at FIU, Thomas and Mary's Court donated $50,000 to FIU's First Generation Scholarship and organized a sell-out charity game during the NBA lockout featuring NBA stars LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, with proceeds benefiting Mary's Court.[61] A street on Chicago's West Side was named in honor of his mother.[62] The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boys & Girls Club of Chicago recognized Thomas's philanthropic work in March 2012 and honored him with the organization's King Legacy Award at their 24th Annual King Legacy Awards Gala. The award is given annually to individuals who have fostered the principles of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. through their community contributions.[63] In July 2012, Thomas joined The Black Men's Roundtable in Florida along with other national and local black leaders to discuss issues that directly affect black males.[64] The Peace League is an annual community basketball league that brings together young men and women from surrounding communities within the Chicago area and provides a safe haven growth and development; it was established by Thomas and Father Pfleger in 2011.[65] In September 2012, Thomas co-hosted the Ballin' for Peace Tournament at St. Sabina Church in Chicago. He joined with Joakim Noah, Taj Gibson, Quentin Richardson, Zach Randolph, the Chicago Bears' J'Marcus Webb, pastor Father Michael Pfleger, and others to produce this event, in order to reduce gang violence through communication and basketball. Thomas also stressed the value of education for those in poverty.[66][67] The Peace League initiative has expanded into a program which now offers GED classes, employment training, and internship opportunities. The surrounding Auburn-Gresham neighborhood has seen a drastic drop in violence since the league began.[68] Most recently, the Peace League Tournament was expanded to New York City during the 2015 NBA All-Star Weekend. The New York City Peace Game featured over 50 players from across all five Boroughs that competed in a tournament as well as a brief speaking program with some special guests, supporters and participating organizations at the Harlem PAL that included Harry Belafonte of Sankofa.org, Help USA, Cure Violence, and Connor Sports.[69][70] In March 2013, Children Uniting Nations, an organization that focuses on advocacy/awareness and provides academic and community-based programs for at-risk and foster youth, presented Thomas and Mary's Court with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his passion and commitment to improving the lives of children.[71] In partnership with the Marillac Social Center, Thomas and Mary's Court hosted its Third Annual Holiday Toy Giveaway.[72] Each year Mary's Court provides gifts, clothing and educational items to hundreds of children in Chicago at this signature event.[73] On February 13, 2017, Thomas was presented the AT&T Humanity of Connection Award during its annual Black History Month celebration in honor of Lewis H. Latimer at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. He was honored for his historic achievements in sports and his countless contributions to the African American community as a leader in the sports, business and philanthropic industries.[74] Isiah Lord Thomas III was the son of Isiah II and Mary Thomas, the youngest of seven boys and two girls. Isiah's father was an army veteran wounded in the Battle of Saipan.[75] He later attended trade school, eventually becoming the first black supervisor at International Harvester in Chicago. When the plant closed, the only work he could find was as a janitor and the family fell into hardship and Isiah II left when Isiah was a young child.[75] Thomas grew up in the heart of Chicago's West Side ghetto. After his parents' separation, he lived with his mother. Born a Baptist, Mary turned the family toward Catholicism. Thomas was a basketball prodigy from age three and was tutored by his older brothers, some of whom were good players in their own right. Although most coaches in the Chicago area considered him too small to have any significant impact on a basketball program, Thomas's brothers persuaded coach Gene Pingatore of St. Joseph High School to arrange a sports scholarship for Isiah. Thomas met his future wife, Lynn Kendall, the daughter of a Secret Service agent and a nurse, in the early 1980s while they were both attending Indiana University. The couple married in 1985. Thomas graduated from Indiana University with a B.A. in 1987. Isiah Thomas and Lynn Kendall had a son, Joshua, in 1988, and a daughter, Lauren, in 1991. Thomas has a third son from an earlier liaison, Marc Dones, born in 1986. Thomas founded Isiah International LLC, an investment holdings company with Thomas as Chairman and CEO. It runs five companies: Isiah Real Estate, a development firm specializing in commercial properties; TAND Properties, a property management firm, private equity and asset management firm; Isiah Marketing, Advertising and Public Relations; and GRE3N Waste Removal. Thomas also co-owns the waste removal's sister company, RE3 Recycling, with his daughter, Lauren Thomas.[76] Isiah Thomas was involved in allegations about gambling, an accusation outlined in the 1997 book Money Players. Two months before Thomas's marriage to Lynn Kendall in 1985, Jenni Dones, a woman from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, filed a paternity lawsuit against Thomas claiming that she was pregnant after having had a three- or four-month ""intimate, exclusive, ongoing relationship"" with him. Her child, Marc E. T. Dones, was born in 1986. After a long-running legal dispute, Thomas agreed to pay a settlement of about $52,000 and provide a monthly payment of $2,765 until Marc Dones reached 18, with Marc getting a final lump-sum amount of $100,000 at 18. In a case Dones filed in 1995, she was able to get additional financial support for her son and his college education. Marc Dones is an aspiring writer and poet who has been described by the literary site thedetroiter.com as ""a talented writer and poet"".[77][78] In January 2006, Anucha Browne Sanders, a former female executive with the New York Knicks, filed an employment and harassment lawsuit against The Madison Square Garden Company, alleging in part that Thomas had sexually harassed her in the workplace and that she had been fired in retaliation for complaining about the harassment. The case was then settled for $11.5 million.[79][80] On October 24, 2008, Thomas was taken to White Plains Hospital Center near his New York City area home after accidentally taking an overdose of Lunesta, a form of sleep medication.[81] He was released from the hospital later that day.[82] In an interview with ESPN, Thomas explained that he was so quiet about his hospitalization because he was focused on his family at the time.[83] In the 1985 NBA All-Star Game, Thomas was joined on the Eastern Conference squad by star rookie Michael Jordan. Jordan wound up attempting nine shots, relatively few for a starting player. Afterward, Thomas and his fellow veteran East players were accused of having planned to ""freeze out"" Jordan from their offense by not passing him the ball, supposedly out of spite over the attention Jordan was receiving. No player involved has ever confirmed that the freeze-out occurred, but the story has long been reported and has never been refuted by Jordan.[84] Thomas has ridiculed the idea that he masterminded the supposed freeze-out as ""ludicrous"", pointing out that he was a relatively young player on a team that included Larry Bird, Julius Erving and Moses Malone.[85] During Jordan's Hall of Fame induction, in which Thomas introduced John Stockton, who was also being inducted, Jordan dismissed the claims about a freeze-out having taken place, saying ""I was just happy to be there, being the young guy surrounded by all these greats, I just wanted to prove myself and I hope that I did prove myself to you guys."" In 1987, Thomas was asked if he agreed with Dennis Rodman's comments on Larry Bird, and reinforced that if Bird were black he ""would be just another good guy"" instead of being portrayed as the league's best player. Thomas later said he was joking and just supporting his teammate.[86] In the Eastern Conference Finals of the 1991 NBA Playoffs, the two-time defending champion Detroit Pistons faced the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. The Pistons had defeated the Bulls in each of the first three meetings, but this time they suffered a four-game sweep at the hands of the Bulls (who would win the first of three consecutive, and six overall, NBA championships between 1991 and 1998). The series was marked by a number of verbal, physical, and match-up problems. With 7.9 seconds remaining in the fourth game, Laimbeer organized a walk-out and Thomas and all of his teammates—except Joe Dumars and John Salley—walked off the court, refusing to shake hands with the Bulls.[87][88] In 1992, Thomas was passed over for the Dream Team apparently because of his strained relationship with Jordan.[89] In September 2009, during Jordan's Hall of Fame acceptance speech, Jordan thanked Thomas and others for giving him the motivation he needed to compete in the NBA.[90]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/294.png
295,Rod Thorn,"May 23, 1941",,"Princeton in Princeton, West Virginia",West Virginia,1982,1982,1,true,,"""[5]""",/coaches/thornro01c.html,"Rodney King Thorn (born May 23, 1941) is an American basketball executive and a former professional player and coach, Olympic Committee Chairman, with a career spanning over 50 years. In 2018, Thorn was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Thorn attracted nationwide attention after a high school basketball career at Princeton High School in his hometown of Princeton, West Virginia that saw him average more than 30 points per game as a senior. He was a three-time all-state selection and was a two-time High School All-American.[1] Thorn was also a highly regarded high school baseball player, before a head injury took him away from the sport for a time.[2] Thorn was looking at colleges, including Duke University, when the West Virginia State Legislature passed a resolution designating Thorn as a state Natural Resource. This in order to persuade him to emulate native Jerry West and attend West Virginia University. Thorn did just that.[2][3] Thorn attended West Virginia University. He wore #44, the same number as Jerry West, who had just graduated.[3] At WVU, he was an All-American guard in basketball, as well as playing three seasons on the WVU baseball team.[4] In 1960-1961, as a sophomore (freshman could not play varsity in his era), Thorn averaged 18.5 points and 12.5 rebounds and 2.7 assists for Coach George King and the 23-4 West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball team.[5] Thorn improved and West Virginia finished 24-6 in 1961-1962. The Mountaineers were invited to the 1962 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament, where they lost to Villanova 90-75.[6] Thorn averaged 23.7 points and 12.1 rebounds. He was the Southern Conference Player of the Year and a 2nd Team All-American selection, beside John Havlicek of Ohio State University, among others.[7][8] In 1962-1963, Thorn averaged 22.5 points and 9.0 rebounds as a senior. West Virginia finished 23-8 and qualified for the 1963 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament. In the NCAA's, they defeated Connecticut 77-71, as Thorn had 17 points and 7 rebounds. Thorn was outstanding in the Mountaineers' 97-88 loss to St. Josephs, scoring 44 points in a 96-88 loss. He then scored 33 points with 9 rebounds in a 83-73 win over New York University in the East Region 3rd place game, his final collegiate game.[9][10] Thorn was again selected as a 2nd Team All-American beside Bill Bradley, among others.[7] Overall, Thorn averaged 21.8 points and 11.1 rebounds in 81 games during his three seasons at West Virginia.[8] Thorn was the No. 2 overall pick of the 1963 NBA draft, drafted by the Baltimore Bullets.[11] In his rookie season 1963-1964, Thorn was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team averaging 14.4 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.7 assists for the Bullets under Hall of Fame Coach Slick Leonard.[12] Following his first season, Thorn was traded on June 18, 1964. Baltimore traded Thorn, with Terry Dischinger and Don Kojis to the Detroit Pistons for Bob Ferry, future Hall of Famer Bailey Howell, Les Hunter, Wali Jones and Don Ohl. In 1964-1965, Thorn averaged 10.7 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.0 assists for the Pistons. The team didn't make the playoffs under Charles Wolf (2-9) and 24 year old player/coach Dave DeBusschere (29-40).[13][14] Detroit, with Thorn averaging 13.9 points, 3.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists, traded him on December 24, 1965. The Pistons sent Thorn to the St. Louis Hawks for John Tresvant and Chico Vaughn. Thorn averaged 8.8 points and 2.4 rebounds in 46 games with the Hawks as a reserve. Playing alongside Future Hall of Famers Richie Guerin (player/coach), Zelmo Beaty, Lenny Wilkins and Cliff Hagan, as well as Joe Caldwell, Paul Silas and Bill Bridges, Thorn saw his minutes reduced. The Hawks lost the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Division Finals 4-3 after having beaten Baltimore 3-0 to advance.[15] In 1966-1967, Thorn averaged 8.8 points and 2.4 rebounds for the Hawks as they added Lou Hudson and finished 39-42. The Hawks defeated the expansion Chicago Bulls 3-0 in the playoffs, before losing to the San Francisco Warriors with Rick Barry and Nate Thurmond 4-2 in the Western Division finals. Thorn averaged 10.2 points in the series.[16][17] On May 1, 1967, Thorn was drafted by the expansion Seattle SuperSonics from the St. Louis Hawks in the NBA expansion draft. He concluded his career as a player with the Seattle SuperSonics (1967–1971).[18] Thorn averaged a career high 15.2 points with 4.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists, in 1967-1968, as the expansion SuperSonics finished 23-58 under Coach Al Bianchi.[19] The SuperSonics improved to 30-52 in 1968-1969, with Thorn averaging 11.5 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.8 assists at age 27.[20] Thorn's teammate from St. Louis, Lenny Wilkins became the player/Coach of the SuperSonics in 1969-1970 and the team improved to 36-46, in Wilkins' first Coaching season. Wilkins would lead the SuperSonics to the NBA Championship in 1979, and would coach in the NBA until 2005, winning 1332 games in 32 seasons.[21][22] Injured, Thorn averaged 2.9 points in 19 games. In 1970-1971, Thorn finished his playing career, playing in 63 games off the bench, averaging 5.6 points and 2.9 assists for the 38-44 SuperSonics.[23] Overall, in eight NBA seasons, Thorn averaged 10.8 points, 3.1 rebounds and 2.6 assists in 466 games.[13] In 1971–72, Thorn joined his former teammate and coach Lenny Wilkins as an assistant with the SuperSonics and the team finished 47-35.[24][25] In 1973, former teammate Kevin Loughery was head coach and hired Thorn as assistant coach of the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association for $15,000.[2] The Nets then won the 1974 ABA championship, led by Julius Erving.[26] Thorn was hired the head coach of the Spirits of St. Louis with then-star Marvin Barnes for the 1975–76 ABA season. The Spirits' roster also included Hall of Famer Moses Malone, Caldwell Jones, Mike D'Antoni, Gus Gerard, Maurice Lucas, Ron Boone, M.L. Carr and Don Chaney But, after a 20-27 start he was fired in December, 1975 and replaced by Joe Mullaney.[27] Thorn had discipline issues with Barnes. ""Marvin would come late for everything,” Thorn said years later. “You couldn’t depend on him. He’d say, ‘I’m giving you 24 and 12 every night. You better talk to the others.’ He’d come late on purpose to show, ‘You don’t control me. I’m in charge.'""[2] Thorn returned to the New York Nets and Loughery as an assistant coach when the franchise joined the NBA in 1976-1977. The team had been forced to move Erving to the Philadelphia 76ers and was playing with a depleted roster. Thorn left the position after the 1977-1978 season to move to the front office in Chicago.[24] In 1978, Thorn became the general manager of the Chicago Bulls and served in that role until March, 1985. Thorn hired Jerry Sloan as Head Coach, drafted Reggie Theus and had Artis Gilmore in the middle. Thorn replaced Sloan on the bench to finish the 1981-1982 season (15-15). [28][29] In 1984, he famously oversaw team's selection of Michael Jordan with the No. 3 pick of the 1984 NBA draft.[30](he also selected track star Carl Lewis, with the draft on the eve of the 1984 Olympic Games, simply for patriotic publicity purposes).[31] Thorn negated numerous trade offers for the Bulls' No. 3 pick in 1984. There was maneuvering for Jordan to go to Philadelphia where North Carolina star Billy Cunningham was the 76ers coach. There was further speculation Thorn might select Jordan's North Carolina’s teammate Sam Perkins, (who was drafted at No. 4), because the Bulls had recently selected shooting guards in previous drafts and Thorn had just traded All-Star Reggie Theus. However, Thorn drafted Jordan, and the Bulls' foundation was in place.[2] Thorn hired Kevin Loughery as head coach and the team struggled with youth. Thorn left the Bulls when he and Loughery were fired in March, 1985 and new owner Jerry Reinsdorf hired Jerry Krause as G.M..[32] From 1986 to 2000 Thorn was the NBA's Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations, serving as the league's chief disciplinarian.[33] Thorn chaired the USA Basketball Men's National Team Selection Committee in 1992, 1996 and 2000. The ""Dream Team"" for the 1992 Summer Olympics (Barcelona) was assembled and the committee put together the Olympic gold-medal USA teams in 1996 and 2000.[34] Thorn rejoined the Nets organization on June 2, 2000, and he was named the NBA Executive of the Year in 2002 after the Nets advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history.[35] During the 2010 offseason, Rod Thorn announced he would step down from the Nets' organization. On August 11, 2010, Thorn was hired as president of the 76ers, taking over the title from Ed Stefanski, who remained with the team as the general manager.[36] On October 18, 2011, prior to a press conference introducing the 76ers' new ownership group, it was announced that Stefanski was leaving the organization and Thorn would be both president and general manager. In 2012, Tony DiLeo was named the team's general manager, but Thorn retained his title as president.[37] On July 10, 2013, the National Basketball Association announced that Rod Thorn had been named President of Basketball Operations, effective August 1, after Stu Jackson decided to step down.[38] On April 26, 2014 Thorn, on behalf of the NBA, suspended Wizard Nene Hilario from game 4 of the first round of the NBA playoffs.[39] In 2015, Thorn briefly retired from the NBA.[40] In 2015, Thorn, semi-retired, became a Special Consultant for the Milwaukee Bucks.[34][41] Of his career, “I’ve been unbelievably fortunate to be in the right place so many times,” said Thorn. “To come from a place with 7,000 people sometimes you pinch yourself and think, ‘Wow, how fortunate I’ve been.’ When I played we got $8 in meal money. We were like a barnstorming league. I can remember playing 16 straight days in preseason in one little high school after the next.

Tomjanovich coached the Houston Rockets to consecutive NBA championships in 1994 and 1995. During his playing career, Tomjanovich was a five-time NBA All-Star forward for the Rockets. Tomjanovich coached Team USA to the gold medal in men's basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Tomjanovich was born in Hamtramck, Michigan, to a family of Croatian descent.[1][2] He attended high school in Hamtramck and later the University of Michigan (from 1967 to 1970). He was a high school teammate of ABA player John Brisker.[3] In college, Tomjanovich set Michigan Wolverines men's basketball career rebounding records that continue to stand.[4] In 1968 he earned second team All-Big Ten honors, which he followed with first-team honors in 1969 and 1970.[5] During 1970 he was also an All-American.[6] Tomjanovich was selected in the 1970 NBA draft as the second overall pick by the San Diego Rockets (the franchise relocated to Houston in 1971), for whom he would play the entirety of his NBA career. He was also drafted in both 1970[7] and 1974[8] by the Utah Stars of the ABA. In his eleven years in the NBA, Tomjanovich had a scoring average of 17.4 points and a rebounding average of 8.1, earning five All-Star Game selections in the process (1974–1977, 1979). He is the third-leading scorer in Rockets history behind Hall of Famers Calvin Murphy and Hakeem Olajuwon. Because his last name was so long, the back of Tomjanovich's jerseys would read ""RUDY T."", rather than his 11 character name. The Rockets retired Tomjanovich's #45 jersey upon the conclusion of his playing career. His collegiate jersey, also #45, was retired by the University of Michigan in 2003. Despite Tomjanovich's noteworthy achievements as a player and coach, he is perhaps most remembered for an infamous event near the height of his playing career. In a game on December 9, 1977, Tomjanovich was punched by Kermit Washington of the Los Angeles Lakers. The blow shattered Tomjanovich's face and inflicted life-threatening head and spinal injuries, leaving him sidelined for five months. He eventually made a full recovery and was selected for the NBA All-Star Game the following season (1978-1979). The incident and its aftermath are recounted in the John Feinstein book The Punch: One Night, Two Lives, and the Fight That Changed Basketball Forever, as well as in Tomjanovich's 1997 autobiography A Rocket at Heart: My Life and My Team. Tomjanovich retired in 1981 and became a scout for two years before being named an assistant coach in 1983. He served as an assistant under Bill Fitch and Don Chaney. Tomjanovich was named the Rockets' interim head coach in February 1992 after Chaney's resignation. After nearly leading the Rockets to a playoff berth, he was then given the job on a permanent basis. In his first full season on the job (1992–93), Tomjanovich guided the Rockets to the Midwest Division title, making him the first head coach to ever take his team from the lottery to a division crown during his first full season. Building on this success, Rudy T. led the team to back-to-back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995; additionally, the Rockets were the only team other than the Chicago Bulls to win multiple championships during the 1990s, with their titles being bookended by the Bulls' two runs of three consecutive titles each. On the playoff run to their second title, the Rockets became the lowest seed (sixth) to win one, and the only team in history to defeat the teams with the four best regular season records in the playoffs. It was on the floor of The Summit after they captured their second title that Rudy proclaimed, ""Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion!"" In his 11-plus season tenure as Rockets head coach, he posted a 503–397 (.559) regular-season record and a 51–39 (.567) playoff mark. His career wins and winning percentage are Rockets franchise records. After the 1998-99 season, the Rockets would not make the playoffs for the rest of his coaching tenure, and would consistently finish in the division cellar; Tomjanovich left the team after the 2002–03 season when he was diagnosed with bladder cancer (from which he has since made a full recovery [9]), ending a 33-year association with the Rockets franchise—including its first 32 years in Houston—as a player, assistant coach and head coach. In 1998, Tomjanovich volunteered to coach the U.S. men's senior basketball team at the FIBA World Championship in Greece. Despite the absence of NBA players due to contract negotiations, Tomjanovich guided the hastily assembled group of CBA players to the bronze medal. In light of his outstanding service in coaching at the 1998 Worlds and his stellar professional resume, Tomjanovich was tabbed to coach the U.S. men's senior team at the Games of the XXVII Olympiad in Sydney, Australia. The U.S. Team won the gold medal with an 8–0 record. On February 15, 2006, Tomjanovich was named director of scouting for USA Men's Basketball. In 2004, Tomjanovich signed a five-year, $30 million contract to replace Phil Jackson as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers.[10] He resigned after 41 games, citing mental and physical exhaustion unrelated to his past bout with bladder cancer. The Lakers paid him a $10 million settlement, leading to speculation that the Lakers had instead terminated his contract.[10][11] Tomjanovich stayed with the Lakers as a consultant. Tomjanovich was well known for his instinctive managerial style and intensity on the bench. Always self-deprecating, he nonetheless heaped tremendous pressure on himself and his assistants to be prepared for each game, several times being hospitalized for exhaustion. After winning back-to-back titles, Tomjanovich deflected much of the praise and eschewed the ""genius"" label assigned to other champion coaches like Chuck Daly and Phil Jackson. His hands-off, easy-going manner with his players gave him a reputation as a ""players coach"", and as such veteran players were eager to play on his teams. Among the stars who requested and were granted trades to Houston during his tenure were Clyde Drexler, Charles Barkley, and Scottie Pippen. In 1970, Tomjanovich married Sophie Migas, a former cheerleader. They have three children, two daughters and one son.[12] He currently resides in Austin, Texas. Tomjanovich has participated with the Texas Children's Cancer Center to help raise funds for cancer research. He has also helped promote a deadbolt called the ""Ultimate Lock"" and CieAura health care products.[13]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/299.png

He previously served as the head coach of the NBA's Toronto Raptors and the interim head coach of the Phoenix Suns. A former Canadian men's national team player who competed in two Olympics, he also had two stints as head coach of the national team. Triano was born in Tillsonburg, Ontario and raised in Niagara Falls, Ontario, where he attended A. N. Myer Secondary School.[2] He is of Italian descent through his great-grandfather, who landed on Ellis Island, then made his way to Welland, Ontario.[3] His younger brother Jeff was a draft pick of the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft, after playing OHL hockey for the Toronto Marlboros. Brady Heslip, his nephew and son of his sister Jody, played basketball at Baylor University and currently plays for the Canadian national team.[4] As a student at Simon Fraser University, the 6 ft 4 in, 194 lb[1] Triano broke or equalled eleven school men's basketball records, including having the most career points with 2,616. At Simon Fraser, he befriended Canadian athlete and activist Terry Fox.[5] He was drafted in the eighth round of the 1981 NBA Draft by the Los Angeles Lakers, but was cut during training camp and never played in the NBA.[6] The same year, he was also drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in the sixth round of the 1981 CFL Draft. Triano was a national team player from 1977 to 1988, captained the team from 1981 to 1988, and played in the 1984 and 1988 Olympics. He led the Canadian team that won Gold at the 1983 World University Games in Edmonton, Alberta, defeating the United States in the semi-finals, which was led by Karl Malone and Charles Barkley,[6] and Yugoslavia in the final, led by Dražen Petrović. He played three seasons of professional basketball, two in Mexico and one (1985–86 season for Fenerbahçe Istanbul) in Turkey. After retiring as a player, he became head coach at his alma mater, Simon Fraser University, in 1988. In 1995, when the Vancouver Grizzlies debuted, he became team Director of Community Relations and worked as the colour commentator for their radio broadcasts. In 1998, Triano became the head coach of the Canadian men's national basketball team. He led them to a 5–2 record and a seventh-place finish in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, losing to France by five points in the quarter-finals. Two years later, he became an assistant coach for the Toronto Raptors, becoming the second Canadian-born coach in the NBA. He served under Lenny Wilkens, Kevin O'Neill, and Sam Mitchell. In 2004, Triano was fired as national team head coach,[7] and was replaced by Leo Rautins the following year. In 2008, Triano was named an assistant coach for United States national team. On February 13, 2008, Triano served as head coach of the Toronto Raptors in their 109–91 victory over the New Jersey Nets, in place of head coach Sam Mitchell, who was absent from the team as a result of the passing of his father-in-law, making history as the first Canadian to serve as head coach for a regular-season NBA game. On December 3, 2008, Triano was named interim head coach of the Raptors after Mitchell was relieved of his coaching duties. He became the first Canadian-born head coach in NBA history.[8] Triano guided the Raptors to a 25–40 mark.[9] On May 12, 2009, Triano was given a three-year deal to remain head coach of the Raptors. In Triano's first full season as the Raptors head coach in the 2009–10 season, Toronto missed the playoffs by one game to the Chicago Bulls, going 2–5 in their last 7 games. The team finished 40–42. In the 2010–11 season, without Chris Bosh on the roster, Triano led the Raptors to a dismal 22–60 record. On June 1, 2011, the Raptors announced they would not be picking up the option on Triano's contract, but gave him another position within the organization, the Vice-President of Pro Scouting. On August 17, 2012, Triano was named as an assistant coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.[10] The following week, Triano was also named head coach of Canada's national team for the second time in his career.[11] On May 18, 2016, it was announced that Triano would take on the associate head coach role (which is the team's leading assistant coach) for the Phoenix Suns.[12] He was reunited with head coach Earl Watson, who played for the Trail Blazers during his final season in the NBA, and was considered a major influence on transitioning to being a full-time coach.[13] The subsequent hiring of Turkish-born Mehmet Okur to the Suns' coaching staff as a player development coach on September 13 in the same year, marked the first time in franchise history that multiple non-American coaches served on the coaching staff in the same season.[14] On October 22, 2017, after a 0–3 start to the season, including one of the worst losses in Suns history and the worst loss to open up a regular season in league history, Triano was promoted to interim head coach of the Suns after the firing of Earl Watson.[15] In his first game as head coach since 2011, Triano managed to lead the team, which previously had 40+ point losses earlier in the year, to lead as high as 22 points at one point before winning 117–115 on October 23, against the Sacramento Kings for their first win of the season. On December 26, 2017, Triano became the first foreign born head coach in NBA history to win 100 games in the league with a 99–97 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. However, the Suns would finish the season with a 21–58 record under his tenure, and he would not return as head coach after that season.[16] On May 24, 2018, the Charlotte Hornets announced that Triano would join their staff as lead assistant coach.[17]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/301.png

Unseld starred for the Seneca High School team that won Kentucky state championships in 1963 and 1964. At the University of Louisville in 1965, he played center for the school's freshman team, averaging 35.8 points and 23.6 rebounds over 14 games. Unseld lettered for Louisville as a sophomore (1965–66), junior (1966–67), and senior (1967–68), scored 1,686 points (20.6 average) and grabbed 1,551 rebounds (18.9 average) over 82 games. He led the Missouri Valley Conference in rebounding all three years. Unseld earned NCAA All-American honors in 1967 and 1968 and led Louisville to a 60–22 record during his collegiate career, making trips to the NIT tournament in 1966 and NCAA tournament in 1967 and 1968. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Unseld was drafted by the Kentucky Colonels in the 1968 American Basketball Association draft, and was drafted second overall in the first round by the Baltimore Bullets in the 1968 NBA draft.[1] In his first career game, Unseld recorded 8 points and 22 rebounds in a 124–116 win over the Detroit Pistons.[2] On October 19, Unseld recorded his first double-double of his career after recording 13 points and 20 rebounds in a 124–121 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.[3] On November 22, Unseld recorded 20 points and a career-high 29 rebounds in a 110-121 loss to the Sixers.[4] As a rookie, Unseld helped lead the Bullets (who had finished in last place in the Eastern division the previous year) to a 57–25 record and a division title. Unseld averaged 18.2 rebounds per game that year, and became the second player ever to win the Rookie of the Year Award and the Most Valuable Player Award in the same year (the first to do this was fellow Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain). Unseld was also named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team, and also claimed the Sporting News MVP that year. Unseld was one of the best defensive players of his era, and in 1975, he led the NBA in rebounding. The following season, he led the NBA in field goal percentage with a .561 percentage. Unseld took the Bullets franchise to four NBA Finals, and won the championship in 1978 over the Seattle SuperSonics, in which he was named the Finals MVP. He ended his playing career following the 1980–81 season, and his No. 41 jersey was retired by the Bullets shortly thereafter. Famed for his rebounding, bone-jarring picks and ability to ignite a fast break with his crisp, accurate outlet passes, Unseld made up for his lack of size with brute strength and sheer determination. In 984 NBA games – all with the Bullets – Unseld averaged a double-double, with averages of 10.8 points and 14.0 rebounds per game, as well as 3.9 assists per game, averaging over 36 minutes played per game. Unseld was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1988, and in 1996, he was named as one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players of all time.[5] After his retirement in 1981, he moved into a front office position with the Bullets, where he served as vice president for six years before being named head coach in 1988.[6] He resigned following the 1994 season with a 202–345 record (.369).[7][8] Unseld became the team's general manager in 1996 and guided the team to the playoffs once during his tenure.

Born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, van Breda Kolff gained an affection for basketball while growing up in Montclair. He attended The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. He then attended Princeton University, where he played basketball for Franklin ""Cappy"" Cappon, and New York University, where he also played basketball. Signed by the New York Knicks in 1946, he spent four seasons playing as a professional. The New York Knicks played in the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which merged with some of the better teams of the National Basketball League to form the National Basketball Association in (NBA) in 1949. In the four years (1946–50) van Breda Kolff played in the BAA and the NBA, he turned in a relatively unimpressive performance, shooting just .305 from the field, .669 from the line, and averaging 4.7 points in 175 contests. He was elected team captain of the Knicks. After leaving the NBA in 1950, van Breda Kolff began a coaching career. He took over as head coach at Lafayette College, where he remained from 1951 to 1955. He then coached for Hofstra University from 1955 to 1962, and Princeton from 1962 to 1967. He is one of four men to have coached both an NCAA Final Four team (Princeton, 1965) and an NBA Finals squad (the Los Angeles Lakers, 1968 and 1969). (The others are Larry Brown, Jack Ramsay, and Fred Schaus.) Van Breda Kolff also spent time running a women's professional team and later coached a high school team in Picayune, Mississippi.[1] ""Coaching is coaching"", he once told a reporter. ""Give me 10 players who want to work and learn the game and I'm happy. I don't count the house."" Van Breda Kolff's success in college attracted the attention of the NBA. The Lakers hired him in 1967, and in his first season guided the team to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics in six games. In his second campaign for the Lakers, his team — with Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, and Wilt Chamberlain — notched a 55-27 record and reached the Finals again, but Van Breda Kolff and Chamberlain did not get along at all (the coach thought his star center was spoiled and openly favored Baylor and West over him, while Chamberlain viewed his coach as a loser and barely tolerated him). Van Breda Kolff took tremendous flak for not allowing Chamberlain back in the game for the final minutes of game 7 of the NBA finals against Boston. Chamberlain picked up his fifth foul midway through the fourth quarter, and shortly thereafter asked out of the game with knee pain. With backup center Mel Counts in the game, the Lakers cut a seven-point deficit to two points. Chamberlain then motioned to Van Breda Kolff that he was ready to go back in the game, to which Van Breda Kolff told him ""sit your big ass down"" and ""we don't need you."" The Lakers lost by two points, and van Breda Kolff resigned before he could be fired by Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke. Game 7 marked the last time he would coach an NBA team in a postseason game. He then went on to Detroit, where he coached the Pistons for just over two seasons. In 1970–71 he guided the team to a 45–37 mark, Detroit's first winning season in fifteen years. He left the team ten games into the next season, stating in a 1984 Sports Illustrated article that he quit after being cursed at repeatedly by frustrated fans. Van Breda Kolff coached the Phoenix Suns for the first seven games of the 1972–73 campaign before being fired and replaced by Jerry Colangelo. He did a stint with Memphis of the American Basketball Association in 1973–74. From 1974 to 1977 he coached the New Orleans Jazz, taking over in the middle of the 1974–75 season and departing with a 14-12 record partway through the 1976–77 season. While he was coach, he pushed for New Orleans to relinquish the rights to Moses Malone in exchange for a #1 draft pick, and then traded that pick and two other #1s to the Lakers for Gail Goodrich. This turned out to be one of the worst decisions in NBA history, not only because Malone became a superstar but because Goodrich suffered an Achilles' tendon injury that would end his career in 1978. The Jazz's #1 pick in 1979 (the first overall choice) was used by the Lakers to select Magic Johnson. While in New Orleans, he also coached the New Orleans Pride, a women's professional squad. He left the professional ranks for good in 1976, taking with him a career NBA coaching record of 266-253 and a .513 winning percentage. 1976 also marked the year his son Jan entered the NBA with the New York Nets; he coached one game against his son's team. Van Breda Kolff often clashed with other strong egos. After leaving the Jazz, he remained in New Orleans and returned to the college coaching ranks with the University of New Orleans, where he spent two years. In 1985, Lafayette, the team he had coached 30 years earlier, asked him to return. Van Breda Kolff stayed four seasons at Lafayette before leaving to coach Hofstra once again. His second stint with the Flying Dutchmen lasted five seasons and ended after the 1993–94 season. In 28 years as a college coach, he compiled a 482-272 record. Van Breda Kolff died August 22, 2007 at a nursing home in Spokane, Washington after a long illness.[2] ""All I know is life isn't much different than that game on the court"", he said in an article in the New York Daily News in the early 1980s. ""If it's run right — with precision, with good, honest effort — it's a thing of beauty. I know what it looks like and that's what keeps me going."" His son Jan van Breda Kolff was also a basketball player and coach.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/304.png
305,Jeff Van Gundy,"January 19, 1962",,"Brockport in Brockport, New York",Nazareth College,1996,2007,11,true,,"""[2, 1]""",/coaches/vanguje99c.html,"Jeffrey William Van Gundy (born January 19, 1962) is an American basketball coach and commentator for ESPN. He has previously been the head coach of the New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets in the National Basketball Association. Van Gundy was born in Hemet, California. He grew up in the town of Martinez, California.[1] He is the son of a basketball coach, Bill Van Gundy, the former head coach at Brockport State University and at Genesee Community College.[2] Jeff's elder brother, Stan, later became head coach of the NBA's Miami Heat and Orlando Magic, and is also the former head coach and director of basketball operations for the Detroit Pistons.[3] As a high-school point guard, he was a two-time All Greater Rochester selection in 1979 and 1980, leading Brockport Central to the Class AA finals. He continued his basketball playing career at Nazareth College, where he earned All-American honors, while leading the Golden Flyers to an NCAA Division III Tournament berth in 1984. He remains the Nazareth career leader in free throw percentage, at 86.8%.[4] Van Gundy attended Yale University, where he was a classmate with Jodie Foster, before transferring to Menlo College, and ultimately graduating from New York's Nazareth College, in 1985.[5] Van Gundy began his basketball coaching career during the 1985–86 season, at McQuaid Jesuit High School, in Rochester, New York. The following year, he became a graduate assistant under head coach Rick Pitino, at Providence College, helping the Providence Friars advance to the Final Four. In his second season with the Friars, he was promoted to assistant coach under Gordon Chiesa. The next season, Van Gundy became an assistant coach under Bob Wenzel, at Rutgers. On July 28, 1989, Van Gundy became an assistant coach for the New York Knicks. He spent the next six-and-a-half seasons providing support to Knicks head coaches Stu Jackson (1989–1990), John MacLeod (1990–1991), Pat Riley (1991–1995) and Don Nelson (1995–1996). During his tenure as an assistant coach, the Knicks won three Atlantic Division titles, never finished lower than third in the division, and qualified for the playoffs every year. The Knicks advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1993, and the NBA Finals versus the Houston Rockets in 1994.[6] On March 8, 1996, Van Gundy was named head coach of the New York Knicks, taking over the reins from Don Nelson.[7] In his second game as head coach, he notably led the Knicks to a 32–point blowout win over the Michael Jordan–led Chicago Bulls, who had eliminated the Knicks from the playoffs four times since 1989.[8] However, Van Gundy was unable to change that trend in the postseason, as the Knicks fell to Chicago in the conference semifinals. In his first full season as head coach, the Knicks tied for the third-best record in franchise history, at 57–25.[9] In the regular season finale, the Knicks defeated the 69–12 Chicago Bulls in Chicago, preventing them from posting two consecutive 70-win seasons in a row, and tying the best home record in NBA history.[10] Van Gundy created a memorable scene in the 1998 NBA Playoffs series between the New York Knicks and the Miami Heat. When the Heat's 6'10"" (2.08 m), 240 lb. (109 kg) center Alonzo Mourning,[11] and the Knicks' 6'7"" (2.01 m),[12] 250 lb. (113 kg) power forward Larry Johnson,[13] engaged in a bench-clearing brawl, Van Gundy unsuccessfully tried to break the fight up. Most memorably, the 5'9"" (1.75 m), 165 lb. (75 kg) Van Gundy[14] fell to the floor, and clung to Mourning's leg.[15] Suspensions were handed down for the brawl, but the Knicks held on to win the series 3-2 and moved on to play the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. In the lockout–shortened 1998–99 season, the Knicks struggled with injuries (namely to All–Star Patrick Ewing) and finished 27–23 to finish as the eighth seed for the playoffs (they had to win six of its remaining eight games just to qualify).[16] In the first round of the playoffs, the Knicks defied expectations and defeated the Heat in five games, avenging the previous season's playoff loss and becoming just the second 8th seed to defeat the number one seed in the playoffs. The win propelled an improbable run for the Knicks, as they swept the Hawks in the semifinals, and defeated the Pacers in six games, to advance to the NBA Finals. Without Ewing, they were no match in the Finals against the Spurs, and lost the series in five games. The Knicks were the first 8th-seeded team in NBA history to reach the NBA Finals. The Knicks followed up their Finals run with a 50–32 season, and advanced to the Conference Finals, where they were defeated by the Indiana Pacers. Until the 2013 playoffs, this was the last time the Knicks won a playoff series. In a 2001 game between the Spurs and Knicks, Danny Ferry elbowed Marcus Camby. While talking to the referee, Camby lost control and tried to punch Ferry. Camby missed and hit Van Gundy instead, who said he learned his lesson about trying to break up fights between players.[17] The Knicks finished 48–34, but lost in the first round to the Raptors. Just 19 games into the 2001–02 season, Van Gundy resigned from the Knick's head coach position.[18] The move was unexpected, as the Knicks were on a winning streak, and coming off a 14–point victory against the Milwaukee Bucks.[19] On June 10, 2003, Van Gundy was named head coach of the Houston Rockets, replacing Rudy Tomjanovich.[20] In his first season as the team's head coach, the Rockets finished with a 45–37 record, and qualified for the playoffs for the first time in five years, but they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Los Angeles Lakers. In his second season with the Rockets, Van Gundy guided the team, led by the Yao Ming/ Tracy McGrady duo, to a 51–31 record, which was their first season with more than 50 wins in eight years. The Rockets once again lost in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the Dallas Mavericks. McGrady and Yao missed a combined 70 games due to injury in the 2005–06 season, and Van Gundy did not make the playoffs for the first time in his NBA head coaching career. In May 2005, Van Gundy was fined $100,000 by the NBA, for accusing referees of targeting Houston Rockets center Yao Ming. Van Gundy blamed Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban for causing the referees' alleged bias. This is the largest fine handed down to a coach in NBA history.[21] The injuries and disappointments continued for the Rockets into the following season, with injuries limiting Yao to just 48 games played, and McGrady also not fully recovered from his injuries. The Rockets went on a late season run, on the back of a resurgence from McGrady, but another first round playoff loss, this time to the Utah Jazz, sealed Van Gundy's fate as the team's head coach. At the conclusion of their decisive game 7 loss in the first round of the playoffs, Van Gundy was fired, and then replaced by Rick Adelman. In July 2017, it was announced that Van Gundy would be the head coach of the senior United States men's national basketball team at the 2017 FIBA AmeriCup tournament, and in the qualifiers for the 2019 FIBA World Cup in China. USA head coach Gregg Popovich would then resume coaching the team at the World Cup, and at the 2020 Summer Olympics, should they qualify for either. Team USA became Van Gundy's first coaching job since leaving the Rockets in 2007.[22] Van Gundy went on to guide the US to the gold medal at the 2017 FIBA AmeriCup, and also to qualify for the 2019 FIBA World Cup.[23] Following his firing from the Houston Rockets in 2007, Van Gundy was a guest analyst for ESPN's broadcast of the Phoenix Suns-San Antonio Spurs game in San Antonio, Texas, and he has since been a regular broadcast member for ESPN.[24] He now calls many basketball games as a color commentator with play-by-play announcer Mike Breen and Mark Jackson, including the NBA Finals.[25] Jeff Van Gundy is an executive board member of Pro-Vision Academy, a charter school and non-profit organization in Houston, that provides educational, job-training, and mentoring services to boys and girls aged 10–18. Van Gundy's older brother is Stan Van Gundy, who was formerly the head coach and president of basketball operations for the Detroit Pistons. On May 8, 2011, Van Gundy received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, from his alma mater, Nazareth College, during the college's 84th Annual Commencement Ceremony.[26]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/305.png
306,Stan Van Gundy,"September 21, 1959",,"Alhambra in Martinez, California",State University of New York at Brockport,2004,2018,12,true,,"""[1, 2, 9]""",/coaches/vangust99c.html,"Stanley Alan Van Gundy (born August 26, 1959)[1] is an American former basketball coach and current NBA analyst who most recently served as the head coach and president of basketball operations for the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 2014 to 2018.[2] From 2003 to 2005, he was the head coach of the Miami Heat but resigned in 2005 mid-season, turning the job over to Pat Riley. Van Gundy then coached the Orlando Magic for five seasons from 2007 to 2012, leading them to the 2009 NBA Finals. He is the brother of former New York Knicks and Houston Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy. Van Gundy was a starting guard at Alhambra High School in Martinez, California in the San Francisco Bay Area. He played basketball for his father, Bill Van Gundy, at SUNY-Brockport, a Division III school, until he graduated in 1981 with a B.A. in English and a B.S. in Physical Education.[3] Van Gundy began his coaching career as an assistant coach at the University of Vermont, 1981–83, and was head coach at Castleton State College in Vermont for three seasons from 1983 to 1986.[3] After his first season as Castleton head coach, the NAIA named Van Gundy the District 5 Coach of the Year.[4] Castleton finished 1984–85 the top team in the NAIA's Mayflower Conference and won the NAIA District 5 tournament.[5][6] After serving as an assistant coach at Canisius College in 1987 and Fordham University in 1988, Van Gundy was named head coach at the University of Lowell. During his four-season tenure at the school, which saw the institution become the University of Massachusetts Lowell, he compiled a record of 54–60 and coached Leo Parent, whom Van Gundy called ""the best Division 2 player in the nation.""[7] Van Gundy then became an assistant at the University of Wisconsin under Stu Jackson.[3] When Jackson left after 2 years to become general manager of the expansion NBA Vancouver franchise, Van Gundy was promoted to replace him as head coach and given a 5-year contract. Coming off an 18–11 season with future NBA star Michael Finley back for his senior year and highly touted recruits coming in, the team went into the season with high expectations, but ended with a disappointing 13–14 record (7–11 and ninth place in the Big 10). Van Gundy was fired at the end of the season and given a buyout for the 4 years remaining on his contract. Van Gundy blamed financial concerns at the school for his firing.[8] The team would go on to hire Dick Bennett from the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay and he finished his first year with a 17–15 record and NIT appearance despite losing Finley and other key players. Overall, Van Gundy compiled a record of 135–92 (.595) in eight years as a college head coach.[3] When Pat Riley left the New York Knicks to coach the Miami Heat, the Knicks refused to let him hire Jeff Van Gundy, perhaps his most valuable assistant. Riley hired Stan, his brother, saying ""I wanted at least one Van Gundy with me"".[9] Stan Van Gundy spent 12 years with the Heat. After working as an assistant under Riley, Van Gundy was named head coach when Riley abruptly resigned as coach prior to the 2003–04 season. However, Riley remained as President of the team. Van Gundy took over a team that had won 25 games the previous season. He led them to a 42-win season, in which they won a very high percentage of their late season games and surprised many by advancing to the second round of the 2004 NBA Playoffs, nearly defeating the team with the league's best record, the Indiana Pacers, due to the strong play of rookie Dwyane Wade. During the off-season, Shaquille O'Neal demanded a trade and made Miami the only viable option for the Lakers to make a transaction with. Riley gave up Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant and a future first-round draft choice, replacing three of the team's starters, including an Olympian and a future all star, with O'Neal. Van Gundy led the Heat to the best record in the Eastern Conference in the first half of the season, becoming the first Heat coach to coach in the All-Star Game, where he led the East to a victory. The Heat finished the season with 59 wins, earning the best record in the conference. The Heat went on to advance to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost to the Detroit Pistons. Injuries played a factor in their defeat, particularly a rib injury to leading scorer Wade during Game 5, which prevented him from playing Game 6 and severely hindered him in Game 7, both Piston wins. During the 2005 off-season, it was widely speculated that Pat Riley was attempting to run Van Gundy out of his coaching job and take over the job himself, now that the team was in a position to contend for the championship.[10] Van Gundy would resign from his position as head coach on December 12, 2005, just 21 games into the season, citing a need to spend more time with his family. Riley replaced him as head coach, and led Miami to their first championship that same season. In Shaquille O'Neal's book, ""Shaq Uncut: My Story"", O'Neal responded to allegations of being a ""coach killer"" and that he forced Van Gundy out of Miami by stating: ""Stan got fired because Pat (Riley) wanted to take over, not because I wanted him out. I had no control over it — not a smidgen of control. We all kind of knew it was coming because Pat and Stan were always arguing. Pat would come down and tell Stan how to do something and Stan would want to do it his own way, and that was a fine game plan if you wanted to get yourself fired.""[11] Though at the time of his resignation Van Gundy asserted he was not being forced out by Riley, he has more recently declined comment on the situation after he accepted a coaching job with the Orlando Magic less than two years later.[12] Riley himself would resign from his coaching duties two years later, following a 15–67 season from the Heat. In May 2007, Van Gundy received an offer to replace the fired Rick Carlisle as head coach of the Indiana Pacers. Van Gundy turned down the offer, but began interviewing for other head coaching jobs. He was considered a lead candidate to become head coach of the Orlando Magic and also the Sacramento Kings. However, the Magic hired Billy Donovan. Shortly thereafter, Donovan decided he wanted to back out of the deal and return to the University of Florida. Finally on June 5, 2007, the Magic released Donovan and offered another contract to Van Gundy.[13] ESPN SportsCenter reported that the Miami Heat allowed Van Gundy to coach the Magic in exchange for a second-round draft pick in 2007 and the right to swap first-round picks in 2008 or another 2008 second-round draft pick and cash. In Van Gundy's first season with the Magic, he guided them to a 52-win season, earning the team's first division championship since the 1995–96 season, and the third-best record in the Eastern Conference. Orlando defeated the Toronto Raptors 4–1 in the first round of the playoffs, advancing to the Eastern Semifinals for the first time in twelve seasons. They were later defeated in the Eastern Semifinals by the Detroit Pistons 4–1. Van Gundy and the Magic won 59 games in 2008–09, the second most in franchise history, along with a second consecutive division championship finished at third place behind Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers. During playoffs, they defeated the Philadelphia 76ers from a deficit of 2-1, before squalling with Boston Celtics in seven games. Later, they defeated 66–16 Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games to advancing to the NBA Finals, Orlando's first Finals appearance since 1995. After suffering a blowout loss in game 1 against the Los Angeles Lakers, the Magic put up a better effort in game 2, but were defeated in overtime. In game 3, the Magic shot 63% for the game, a Finals record, en route to their first win in a Finals game in franchise history. They went on to lose the next two games, a controversy decision of putting Jameer Nelson that return from four month absence injury player to replacing both Rafer Alston and Anthony Johnson to play in heavy minutes and decided not fouling the opposite team in less than 30 second on game 4, that ultimately costed them the title as the Lakers won the series in five.[14] Also during the 2008–09 season, a feud developed between Van Gundy and the then Phoenix Suns' center, and former Magic/Heat player, Shaquille O'Neal (the two were together when O'Neal played for the Heat and Van Gundy was his coach). After a game between the Suns and Magic, Van Gundy said O'Neal was flopping throughout the night. O'Neal fired back by calling Van Gundy ""a master of panic,"" because Van Gundy was not successful in the playoffs per O'Neal.[15] On January 31, 2010, Van Gundy was named the coach of the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, making it the second time he had been given the honor to coach an all-star team. He led the Eastern Conference to victory for the second time.[16] On May 21, 2012, Van Gundy was relieved of his duties as head coach.[17] Prior to the firing, Van Gundy had stated that he had knowledge that Dwight Howard wanted him fired. Van Gundy stated that a person within management had told him this, and that the team did not want to risk angering Howard (Howard had an opt-out clause in his contract).[18] Howard still requested a trade after the season,[19] and was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in August 2012.[20] On May 14, 2014, Van Gundy was hired as the new head coach and president of basketball operations of the Detroit Pistons, replacing interim head coach John Loyer.[2] On February 9, 2015, Van Gundy became the 43rd coach in NBA history to win 400 games when the Pistons defeated the Atlanta Hawks 105–95. He clinched a berth in the 2016 playoffs. On May 7, 2018, the Pistons announced that Van Gundy was released from his duties as head coach and president of basketball operations.[21] Van Gundy was born in Indio, California. He grew up as a son of a basketball coach, Bill Van Gundy, the former head coach at Brockport State University in Western New York. His younger brother Jeff Van Gundy has coached two teams in the NBA as well. After Jeff became a member of the NBA on ABC's broadcast team, he was an analyst during the 2009 NBA Finals while Stan coached the Orlando Magic. He returned to being an analyst in September 2018, now working with ESPN (SVG Wednesday on The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz) He is also teaching a sports business course at Stetson University. Van Gundy left ESPN in 2019 to work for Turner/CBS Sports.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/306.png
307,Kiki Vandeweghe,"August 1, 1958",,"Pacific Palisades in Pacific Palisades, California",UCLA,2010,2010,1,true,,"""[3]""",/coaches/vandeki01c.html,"Ernest Maurice ""Kiki"" VanDeWeghe III (born August 1, 1958) is an American basketball executive. He serves as the Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations of the National Basketball Association (NBA). VanDeWeghe is a retired professional basketball player and was formerly the general manager of the Denver Nuggets and the New Jersey Nets, and a head coach of the Nets. VanDeWeghe was born in Wiesbaden, West Germany, the son of former NBA player Ernie Vandeweghe and Colleen Kay Hutchins, the winner of the 1952 Miss America pageant. He is also the nephew of another NBA player, four-time All-Star Mel Hutchins. He has a niece, Coco Vandeweghe, who is a professional tennis player. VanDeWeghe and his wife Peggy have one son, Ernest Maurice VanDeWeghe IV, born in 2002. As a player, VanDeWeghe was regarded as an excellent scorer and outside shooter, averaging 20 points for seven consecutive seasons. He was particularly known for his use of the stepback, a move he was so proficient at that it was often referred to as the ""Kiki Move"" toward the end of his career.[1] VanDeWeghe's teams qualified for the NBA playoffs in 12 of his 13 seasons in the league, although none of his teams ever won the NBA championship. For the bulk of his career, VanDeWeghe spelled his surname ""Vandeweghe"" (with only the V capitalized), a spelling used by his parents before their deaths, and still used by his niece who has a prominent tennis career. In 2013, he announced he was changing the spelling of his name to ""VanDeWeghe"", in honor of his recently departed paternal grandfather and namesake.[2] VanDeWeghe played four seasons at UCLA, culminating in a senior season in which expectations for the Bruins were lower than in previous seasons. The team was coming off a season in which they lost three starters, David Greenwood, Roy Hamilton, and Brad Holland to the NBA as first-round draft picks. Also, the Bruins had a new coach, Larry Brown, who was coaching a collegiate team for the first time. Replacing this talent were some mainly unknown freshman, namely ""Rocket"" Rod Foster, Michael Holton, and Darren Daye, along with sophomore Mike Sanders. VanDeWeghe and James Wilkes were the lone seniors. The team was sluggish at the first, but gelled toward the end and finished the regular season 17-9. The Bruins, dubbed ""Kiki and the Kids"", were the 48th and final team selected to participate in the 1979–80 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. With VanDeWeghe leading the way, the Bruins made it all the way to the final, upsetting #1 DePaul and Mark Aguirre on the way. In the final, the Bruins lost to the University of Louisville led by Darrell Griffith. VanDeWeghe was drafted 11th overall in the 1980 NBA draft by the Dallas Mavericks, but refused to play for Dallas and demanded a trade (for virtually the remainder of his career, he was subjected to boos whenever he played in Dallas). He got his wish, and was traded to the Nuggets on December 3 of that same year. As a member of the Nuggets, VanDeWeghe was twice selected to the NBA Western Conference All-Star team, in 1983 and 1984. He was second in scoring in 1983, averaging 26.7 points, and 3rd in 1984 with a career-high 29.4 points. During the 1983–84 Nuggets season, VanDeWeghe scored 50 or more points in two NBA record-setting games. The former game, on December 13, 1983, in which he had a career-high 51 points, is also the highest combined scoring game in NBA history, a 186-184 triple-overtime loss to the Detroit Pistons.[3] VanDeWeghe subsequently had 50 points in another high-scoring game, this one a 163-155 win over the San Antonio Spurs on January 11, 1984 (at the time, the highest combined scoring NBA regulation game of all time).[4] In the summer of 1984, VanDeWeghe was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Calvin Natt, Wayne Cooper, Fat Lever, and two draft picks. VanDeWeghe had several productive seasons in Portland, where he averaged nearly 25 points a game. He paired with Clyde Drexler to form a dynamic scoring duo. However, during the 1987–88 season, VanDeWeghe suffered a back injury and lost his starting job to Jerome Kersey. He was traded the next year to the New York Knicks (where his father played his entire career), with whom he played for several years. He then played half a season with the Los Angeles Clippers before retiring from the league after the 1992–93 season. VanDeWeghe initially had a front-office role with the Dallas Mavericks, where he was instrumental in the development of Dirk Nowitzki. During his time in Dallas, VanDeWeghe also briefly served as an assistant head coach. On August 9, 2001, VanDeWeghe was named to the Nuggets' general manager position and oversaw a return by the Nuggets to the NBA playoffs. Major moves by VanDeWeghe included the drafting of Carmelo Anthony in 2003, the trade for Marcus Camby in 2002 and the hiring of George Karl as head coach in 2005. However, some other moves by VanDeWeghe backfired outright or failed to produce the desired returns, such as the drafting of draft bust Nikoloz Tskitishvili in 2002 and the sign-and-trade deal with the New Jersey Nets to acquire Kenyon Martin at the end of the 2003–04 season. Shortly following a first-round playoff elimination at the hands of the Clippers in the 2006 playoffs, the Nuggets announced that VanDeWeghe's contract would not be renewed. He spent 2006–07 as an NBA analyst for ESPN, appearing on the channel's SportsCenter and NBA Shootaround programs, among others. However, on December 31, 2007, the Nets announced that VanDeWeghe would join the team as a special assistant to team president and general manager Rod Thorn. VanDeWeghe replaced Ed Stefanski, who left the Nets to join the Philadelphia 76ers earlier in the month. Stefanski replaced Billy King as the 76ers' general manager. On December 1, 2009, VanDeWeghe agreed to assume duties as interim head coach of the Nets while continuing to be general manager of the team (although assistant coach Tom Barrise served as head coach for their December 2 game). VanDeWeghe replaced Lawrence Frank as head coach after the Nets started the 2009–10 season with 16 consecutive losses. VanDeWeghe hired Del Harris as an assistant, who was to be his ""virtual co-coach"",[5] though he resigned midway through the season on February 2, 2010.[6] Harris resigned after he learned that a possible side deal that he had made with VanDeWeghe to become head coach had failed.[7] After Nets ownership changed hands, Mikhail Prokhorov announced that VanDeWeghe would not return the following season. VanDeWeghe joined the leadership team of the NBA in 2013, and currently serves as Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.[8]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/307.png
308,Jacque Vaughn,"February 11, 1975",,"John Muir in Pasadena, California",Kansas,2013,2015,3,true,,"""[2]""",/coaches/vaughja01c.html,"Jacque Vaughn (born February 11, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player and coach who is currently an assistant coach for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA).[1] A native of Pasadena, California, Vaughn attended John Muir High School in nearby Pasadena, where he maintained a 3.94 GPA in honors and AP courses,[citation needed] and became the best high school player in that area since former Muir and NBA standout Stacey Augmon. Vaughn excelled both on and off the court, and by his senior year was ranked as high as the #7 high school recruit in the country and the #2 point guard in the class of 1993 behind arguably the nation's top player that year, Randy Livingston. Over the course of the season, Vaughn averaged over 21 points and 19 assists per game, while also compiling six triple-doubles. Named a First-Team All-American by nearly every publication on the market, Vaughn rounded off his special season with a selection to participate in the prestigious McDonald's All-American Game where he put on a show, scoring only 6 points but amassing 13 assists (still a McDonald's record), while also thoroughly outplaying the higher-ranked Livingston once again—this time on a national stage (they had both matched up against each other in the All-Star Game of the 1992 Nike Camp), and was named co-MVP with North Carolina's Jerry Stackhouse in the process. After considering Georgetown, Indiana, UNLV, Arizona and UCLA, Vaughn decided to play for coach Roy Williams at Kansas, continuing, along with fellow recruit and college roommate Scot Pollard, the California pipeline of high school hoopsters to Lawrence, Kansas, started by former standouts Adonis Jordan and Rex Walters, and continuing in later years with Paul Pierce, and Eric Chenowith. As a senior in high school in 1993, Vaughn was awarded the Dial Award as the nation's top male high school scholar-athlete, becoming the first basketball player ever to win that award. In his college career Vaughn became the starting point guard as a freshman after being chosen to replace incumbent starter Calvin Rayford. Among his first-year highlights were earning the MVP award at the 1993 Pre-Season NIT at Madison Square Garden in New York City and hitting a game-winning three pointer at the overtime buzzer to beat Indiana in an early season game at Allen Fieldhouse.[2] Throughout his four years at Kansas, Vaughn was known as a good distributor of the basketball and effective defender with great speed and court awareness. By the end of his college career, he was the all-time leader in assists in Kansas basketball history with 804 total (since surpassed by Aaron Miles), as well as the Big Eight Conference's all-time record holder. In 1997, the award given annually to the school's assist leader was renamed to include Vaughn, Miles and original assists leader, Cedric Hunter, as the Hunter/Vaughn/Miles Assists Award. Vaughn earned a 3.72 GPA as a Business Administration major.[3] He was a two-time Academic All-American at Kansas and the 1997 GTE Academic All-American of the Year. He was also a two-time all-conference pick and was named the Big Eight Player of the Year in 1996. His college jersey was retired on December 31, 2002 and hangs in the rafters of Allen Fieldhouse.[4] In 1997, Vaughn was selected 27th overall by the Utah Jazz in the 1997 NBA draft. In addition to playing four seasons in Utah, Vaughn also played with the Orlando Magic, the Atlanta Hawks (in two separate stints), New Jersey Nets, and San Antonio Spurs. He appeared in 64 games for the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs during the 06-07 season and finished his career there, retiring after the 08-09 season. Over his career, he averaged 4.5 points per game and 2.5 assists per game. He also set an NBA record for consecutive missed field goal attempts to open a season, missing his first 22 to start the 2001 season with the Atlanta Hawks. After those 22 straight misses he shot a career best 47% that season. Vaughn was an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs from 2010 to 2012. On July 28, 2012, Vaughn was named the new head coach of the Orlando Magic.[5] On February 5, 2015, he was fired by the Magic.[6] Vaughn and his wife Laura, who was his college girlfriend, have two sons, Jalen and Jeremiah.

311,Dick Vitale,"June 9, 1939",,,Seton Hall,1979,1980,2,true,,"""[9]""",/coaches/vitaldi99c.html,"Richard John ""Dick"" Vitale (/vaɪˈtæl/; born June 9, 1939), also known as ""Dickie V"", is an American basketball sportscaster. A former head coach in the college and professional ranks, he is well known as a college basketball broadcaster for ESPN. He is known for catchphrases such as ""this is awesome baby"" and ""diaper dandy"" (outstanding freshman player), as well as enthusiastic and colorful remarks he makes during games, and has authored nine books and appeared in several movies. Vitale was born in Passaic, New Jersey, and grew up in East Rutherford, New Jersey. His father, John, was a piece work clothing press operator and had a second job as a security guard.[1] His mom, Mae, worked in a factory as a seamstress and sewed coats until she suffered a stroke.[2] In kindergarten, Vitale lost the vision in his left eye due to an accident with a pencil. Vitale graduated from East Rutherford High School, and in 1963, he graduated from Seton Hall University with a bachelor of science degree in business administration. He later earned a master's degree in education from what is now William Paterson University. Vitale took his first job as a coach at an elementary school in Garfield, New Jersey in 1958. Eventually he moved up to the high school level to become head coach at Garfield High School for one season, and then at East Rutherford High School (his alma mater), where he had a record of 131–47 from 1964 to 1971 and led his teams to two New Jersey state championships.[3] In 1971, Vitale moved to Rutgers University as an assistant coach under head coach Dick Lloyd. After two seasons there, he was hired in 1973 by the University of Detroit to become its head coach. Vitale took Detroit to the 32-team NCAA tournament in 1977. Vitale had a 78–30 record during his tenure at Detroit, which included a 21-game winning streak during the 1977 season. During that streak the Titans defeated the eventual champion Marquette, on the road, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Following the 1977 season, his fourth as Detroit head coach, Vitale was named the university's athletic director. Vitale coached the Detroit Pistons of the NBA for the 1978–79 season, leading them to a 30–52 (.366) record.[4] On November 8, 1979, Pistons owner Bill Davidson came to Vitale's house and told him that the Pistons were making a coaching change. It was twelve games into the 1979–80 season, after the Pistons struggled to a 4–8 start. The primary reason for Vitale's downfall with the Pistons was the maneuver that brought Bob McAdoo to Detroit. M.L. Carr's decision to sign with Boston as a free agent in 1979 spawned a transaction in which the Pistons, entitled to compensation for Carr, demanded Bob McAdoo, whom the Celtics were looking to unload due to injuries. The Pistons sent two 1980 first-round draft picks (in addition to Carr) to the Celtics in exchange for McAdoo in a combination free agent signing/trade. The Pistons would have the worst season in franchise history in 1979–80, and their pick would become the first overall pick in the 1980 draft. Boston then traded the two picks to the Warriors (who selected Joe Barry Carroll with the #1 pick and Rickey Brown with the #13 pick) in exchange for Robert Parish and the #3 pick (Kevin McHale). Vitale married Lorraine McGrath in 1971. The couple have two daughters, Terri and Sherri,[5] and five grandchildren.[6] Following his departure as coach of the Detroit Pistons, Scotty Connal gave Vitale his first TV opportunity at the then fledgling ESPN cable network. His first reaction to the job of broadcaster was ""Absolutely no way. I know nothing about TV. I want to get back to where I belong and my spirit belongs."" He was reluctant to accept the position but his wife Lorraine told him to ""go on TV and have some fun,"" so Vitale accepted on a temporary basis until another coaching job became available. He called ESPN's first college basketball game on December 5, 1979, when DePaul defeated Wisconsin 90–77.[7] His first play-by-play partner was Joe Boyle. Vitale was not a natural at first for broadcasting. He missed his first-ever production meeting when he was walking the streets of Chicago. Also, he would talk while the producers were talking to him through his earpiece, during commercials, and while the play-by-play man was talking. Vitale himself was not sure if broadcasting would fit him. Connal, who had hired him, told him, ""You have a quality we can't teach."" Vitale did not understand this until many people wanted his autograph at the 1983 Final Four. He credits a lot of his success to working with Jim Simpson at the beginning of his career. In 1985, after the American Broadcasting Company acquired ESPN, Vitale also began doing broadcasts on the ABC network. In 1999, Vitale was featured in a series of thirty-second promo shorts for ""Hoops Malone"". The shorts, which aired in heavy rotation on ESPN, were presented as a sitcom featuring Vitale, George Gervin and others, including a puppet called ""O'Hoolix"". ESPN promoted ""Hoops"" with banners and other marketing premiums, with the idea of generating buzz about the show, but no actual episodes were ever produced. Though this led to an offer for Vitale to do an actual sitcom, he turned down the opportunity. In December 2002, Vitale called a St. Vincent – St. Mary's–Oak Hill Academy prep game, featuring then high school phenom LeBron James. He announced the game with Brad Nessler and NBA great Bill Walton.[8] By the 2004–05 season, Vitale was doing approximately 40 games a year.[9] Vitale is signed with ESPN through the 2021–22 college basketball season.[10] Vitale was recruited to do color in the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament by CBS but ESPN would not allow it. However, ESPN's analysts Jay Bilas and Len Elmore were allowed to provide color for CBS's tournament coverage, teaming with play-by-play announcers Dick Enberg and Gus Johnson. However, this is slightly misleading as Elmore continues to call games for both CBS and ESPN during the college basketball season; in Bilas' case he was loaned to CBS for the tournament only in 2003 and from 2005–2010. In February 2015, ESPN removed Vitale from covering Duke-UNC basketball. He had covered every Duke-UNC game televised by ESPN since 1979.[11] Vitale is a voter on the AP Top 25 men's basketball polls, the annual Naismith Award and the John Wooden Award. Vitale called his first NBA game on television since the 1984 NBA playoffs, along with Dan Shulman, on January 7, 2009 when the Miami Heat played the Denver Nuggets as ESPN swapped its NBA and NCAA crews. During ESPN's first incarnation covering the NBA, he regularly covered games. As of 2009, Vitale had called close to a thousand games. Vitale, a color commentator, is primarily paired with play-by-play announcers Mike Patrick, primarily those in the ACC games; and Dan Shulman for Saturday Primetime and other non-ACC games. During the postseason, he appears as an in-studio analyst with host Rece Davis and fellow analysts Jay Bilas, Digger Phelps, Hubert Davis, and Bob Knight. Previously, he has been paired with Keith Jackson, Roger Twibell, and Brent Musburger for ABC as well as Jim Simpson, Tim Brando,[12] Mike Tirico, Dave O'Brien, Sean McDonough and Brad Nessler. He worked in the studio with Bob Ley, John Saunders, Tirico, and Chris Fowler as well as Jim Valvano.[13] On September 5, 2008 Vitale was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor to the sport, after falling just short of induction the previous year. In 2011 the University of Detroit named their basketball court in his honor. On August 18, 2012, he was inducted into the Little League Museum Hall of Excellence.[14] 2016 New Jersey Hall of Fame inductee. Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. Dick Vitale lent his name, voice and likeness to the 1994 Sega Genesis college basketball video game, Dick Vitale's ""Awesome Baby"" College Hoops (a title developed and sold by Time Warner Interactive.) and only released in the U.S and Australia.[15] Later, Vitale and Brad Nessler provided the commentator voices for EA Sports' NCAA Basketball (formerly NCAA March Madness) video game series until its 2010 discontinuation. In 2004, Vitale released a descriptive autobiography co-written with Dick Weiss, entitled Living a Dream. The book has several thoughts and comments on his days with the Pistons and ESPN, and memories of former NC State basketball Coach Jim Valvano. Vitale has appeared in commercials for DiGiorno pizza, Oberto beef jerky, the Airborne Athletics basketball training device Dr. Dish, and Hooters restaurants. In 1988, Vitale had a cameo appearance as a baseball color commentator, sharing the crowded broadcast booth with Curt Gowdy, Jim Palmer, Dick Enberg, Mel Allen, Tim McCarver and Joyce Brothers in The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!. He guest starred on The Cosby Show along with friend Jim Valvano as furniture movers in the eighth-season episode The Getaway. Other film appearances have generally been Vitale playing himself and commentating the fictional games occurring in those films.

He has also been the head coach for the Indiana Pacers and Orlando Magic. Vogel previously served as an assistant coach of the Pacers, Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics. Vogel grew up in Wildwood Crest, New Jersey. During his eighth grade year, he was featured in an episode of Late Night with David Letterman during the Stupid Human Tricks segment, in which he spun a basketball on a toothbrush while brushing his teeth.[3] On December 10, 1990, Vogel's childhood home caught fire and destroyed everything in the house. Vogel, who was 17 years old at the time, and his mother—the only two people in the house at the time—escaped out of a window.[4] He graduated from Wildwood High School in 1991.[5][6] At Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, Vogel was a starter for the Division III basketball team.[7] In 1994, Vogel transferred to the University of Kentucky. Vogel served as the student manager for the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team then coached by Rick Pitino in the 1994–95 season. The following season, Pitino resurrected the junior varsity Kentucky basketball team and Vogel played for them.[7][8] Vogel graduated from Kentucky with a B.S. in biology in 1998.[1][8] Vogel began his career as the head video coordinator for the Boston Celtics under head coach Rick Pitino. He retained that position for five years before being promoted to assistant coach in the 2001-02 season.[8] After coaching with Boston, Vogel went on to become an assistant for the Philadelphia 76ers. Vogel left the 76ers to become an advance scout for the Los Angeles Lakers from 2005 to 2006 and the Washington Wizards from 2006 to 2007.[5] Vogel then became an assistant for the Indiana Pacers under former Celtics colleague Jim O'Brien. In January 30, 2011, after O'Brien was fired from his head coaching position, Vogel was named interim coach.[9] As interim coach, Vogel led the Pacers to the playoffs for the first time since 2006. Vogel was officially named as the Pacers' head coach on July 6, 2011.[10] Shortly before the Indiana Pacers were to take on the Miami Heat in the 2012 Eastern Conference semifinals, Vogel criticized his opponents for alleged flopping: ""They are the biggest flopping team in the NBA. It'll be very interesting (to see) how the referees officiate the series and how much flopping they reward... Every drive to the basket, they have guys not making a play on the ball, but sliding in front of drivers. Often times they're falling down even before contact is even being made. It'll be interesting to see how the series is officiated.""[11] He was fined $15,000 by the league for these remarks.[12] On April 7, 2013, the Pacers clinched their first Central Division title since the 2003–04 season. They finished the 2012–13 season with a 49–32 record, clinching the third seed in the Eastern Conference. After defeating both the Atlanta Hawks and the New York Knicks in 6 games, the Pacers went on to face the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 1, the Pacers were defeated by the Heat 103–102 in overtime after LeBron James drove by Paul George for a wide-open layup with 2.2 seconds left on the clock.[13] Vogel was roundly criticized for leaving the Pacers' primary defender, Roy Hibbert, on the bench during the final play.[14] Vogel said that he made that decision out of concern of Chris Bosh and acknowledged that he might do it differently next time.[13] In a back-and-forth series where neither team won consecutive games, the Pacers lost in seven games. On January 14, 2014, Vogel was named the Eastern Conference head coach for 2014 NBA All-Star Game.[15] He had guided the team to their best start in franchise history, en route to a 56–26 record, good for first in the Eastern Conference. However, for the second consecutive year, the Pacers lost to the Miami Heat in the Conference Finals. Vogel signed a two-year contract extension with the Indiana Pacers, to keep him through 2016.[16] With Paul George missing all but six games of the season due to injury, the Pacers just missed the playoffs due to tiebreakers with the Brooklyn Nets. Vogel brought the team back to the playoffs with a retooled and rejuvenated roster the following season, however they fell to the Toronto Raptors in seven games in the first round. On May 5, 2016, following the loss to the Raptors, Pacers' president Larry Bird announced that Vogel's contract would not be renewed, citing a need for ""a new voice"" to lead the players.[17][18] He departed Indiana as the franchise's all-time leader in NBA wins (Bobby ""Slick"" Leonard has the most total victories as the Pacers' head coach, with the majority coming in the ABA). On May 20, 2016, Vogel was named the head coach of the Orlando Magic.[19] He oversaw a young, developing team and dealt with a change in the front office after his first year when Rob Hennigan; the GM who hired him, was replaced with John Hammond.[20] He went 54-110, missing the playoffs both seasons. On April 12, 2018, Vogel was fired by the Magic after the conclusion of the 2017–18 season.[21] On May 13, 2019, Vogel was named the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers.[22][23]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/312.png

He is also the former President of Basketball Operations for the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers. Walsh was born in Manhattan, New York City, and attended Fordham Preparatory School in The Bronx, New York. Walsh was recruited to play college basketball at the University of North Carolina for then head coach Frank McGuire. After McGuire was forced out following NCAA violations, Walsh was a senior captain on Dean Smith's first team in 1961. Walsh was selected by the San Francisco Warriors in the 11th round of the 1962 NBA draft (after the Warriors moved from Philadelphia), but never played in the NBA. Walsh earned both a bachelor's degree and a law degree at UNC. While attending law school, he served as an assistant coach on Coach Dean Smith's staff at UNC.[1] He turned down opportunities to practice law in New York City in order to continue to coach basketball.[1] Walsh served as an assistant coach for several college teams, including twelve seasons at the University of South Carolina, working with McGuire, who was the Gamecocks' head coach. He helped South Carolina to an undefeated ACC regular season in 1970, an ACC Tournament championship in 1971, and three consecutive Sweet 16 appearances from 1971 to 1973. Walsh was hired as an assistant with the Denver Nuggets by Larry Brown. He became the head coach of the Nuggets in 1979 and held the position for a year and a half, being replaced with Doug Moe in 1980. In 1984, he became an assistant with the Indiana Pacers. He later took a position as general manager with the Pacers, where in 1987 he made the then-controversial decision to select Reggie Miller in the NBA Draft over local hero Steve Alford of Indiana University. The decision later proved to be prescient, as Miller had a Hall of Fame NBA career whereas Alford was a bust in the pros. He was later promoted to the position of CEO and president and held that position until shortly before the end of the 2007–08 season. During his first tenure with the Pacers, the team reached the playoffs 17 times, the Eastern Conference Finals six times, the NBA Finals once, and were Central Division Champions four times. In 2001 with the Pacers, he was named the Bloomberg News Service NBA Top Basketball Executive. During his time as the president and CEO, he oversaw all operations of the Pacers Foundation, Indiana Fever (WNBA), and Conseco Fieldhouse. On April 2, 2008, the New York Knicks announced that Walsh had agreed to become their president of basketball operations.[2] Walsh immediately recognized the expensive long-term contracts the Knicks carried, and traded Jamal Crawford for Al Harrington. That same day,[when?] Walsh traded Mardy Collins and Zach Randolph for Cuttino Mobley and Tim Thomas. Though Mobley retired of a heart condition, his contract, as well as those of Harrington and Thomas, expired at the end of the 2009–2010 NBA season, decreasing the Knicks' payroll by $27 million and giving them enough cap space to sign anyone notable from the heralded free agent class of 2010 which included NBA players such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Amar'e Stoudemire, and Joe Johnson. Walsh's first major signing came on July 8, 2010, when he signed Amar'e Stoudemire to a five-year, $100 million contract. In the 2010–2011 season, Walsh made a multi-player trade with Denver involving star players Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups coming to the Knicks in exchange for a few players, including Raymond Felton and Danilo Gallinari, and undisclosed amounts of cash. On June 3, 2011, Walsh resigned as general manager, but remained with the team as a consultant.[3] On June 27, 2012, Walsh returned to the Pacers as President of Basketball Operations as Larry Bird stepped down.[4] In 2013, Walsh helped the Pacers win the Central Division and reach the NBA Eastern Conference Finals, where the team lost to eventual NBA Champion Miami Heat. On June 27, 2013, Bird returned to the Pacers as President of Basketball Operations; Walsh stepped down from his role as president and accepted a position as a consultant.[5] Walsh still attends Pacers games, usually seated near Bird and team general manager Kevin Pritchard.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/314.png

After the 2010 NBA Finals, Walton and his father, Hall of Famer Bill Walton, became the first father and son to have both won multiple NBA championships: Bill won in 1977 and 1986, and Luke in 2009 and 2010.[1] His best season statistically was 2006–07 with over 11 points, 5 rebounds, and over 4 assists per game. As the Warriors' interim head coach in 2015–16, he guided the team to the longest winning streak to open a season in league history at 16 games. The son of Susie and former UCLA star and NBA Hall-of-Famer Bill Walton, Luke Walton was born in San Diego, California. He was named after his father's close friend and former Portland Trail Blazers teammate Maurice Lucas.[2] He has three brothers: Adam, Nathan, and Chris. Walton attended University of San Diego High School in San Diego, California,[3] graduating in 1998. Walton played basketball at the University of Arizona under coach Lute Olson. His best year statistically was as a junior, when he averaged 15.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.6 steals and 0.6 blocks per game. During his senior year he averaged 10.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 0.9 steals per game. Walton graduated from Arizona in the spring of 2003 after completing work in family studies and human development. Walton was selected by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2003 NBA draft with the second pick of the second round (32nd overall). Walton was a favorite of Lakers fans during his nine-year stint as a selfless, hard-working reserve player.[4] He was chosen to represent Team Los Angeles in the Shooting Stars Competition during All-Star Weekend in 2005.[5] In 2006–07, Walton had his best year in the NBA. He scored a career-high 25 points against the Atlanta Hawks on December 8, 2006. For the season he posted career-high per-game averages in minutes, field goal percentage, steals, blocks, rebounds, assists and points as the Lakers starting small forward. Following the season, on July 12, 2007, Walton was signed by the Lakers to a 6-year, $30 million contract.[6] The Lakers then made three straight runs to the NBA Finals; they lost to the Celtics in 2008, but defeated the Magic in 2009 and Celtics in 2010 to win back-to-back championships. This gave Walton two championships as a player, the same amount his father won. On March 15, 2012, Walton was traded along with Jason Kapono and a 2012 first-round draft choice to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Ramon Sessions and Christian Eyenga.[7] Walton's first coaching experience was with the University of Memphis, which hired Walton as an assistant coach during the 2011 NBA lockout.[8] He remained an assistant at Memphis until the lockout was over. Following his retirement Walton was hired as a player development coach by the Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA Development League, joining the team in November 2013 for the 2013–14 season.[9] The following season in 2014–15, Walton became an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors. Said Walton, ""We are gonna run parts of the triangle offense, and I know that thing front and back.""[10] The Warriors won the 2015 NBA Finals after they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games to give Walton his third NBA championship and first as a coach. During 2015–16 training camp in October 2015, Walton was appointed as the Warriors interim head coach when Steve Kerr took an indefinite leave of absence to rehabilitate his back that had been bothering him after the NBA Finals.[11][12] Walton made his coaching debut in the season opener on October 27 in a 111–95 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Three games later, he presided over the third-largest margin of victory in franchise history when the Warriors defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 119–69, which was also the largest margin in the league since 1991.[13] The Warriors set a new NBA record by winning their first four games by a total margin of 100 points.[14] With a win over the Los Angeles Lakers on November 24, he guided the Warriors to a 16th consecutive victory to start the season, a new NBA record.[15] Walton was named the NBA Western Conference Coach of the Month for games played in October and November, after guiding Golden State to a 19–0 start.[16] He received the award despite technically being winless, since the Warriors' record was credited to Kerr. Since Kerr was still the head coach, NBA rules stipulated that the team's record under an interim coach be credited to the head coach,[17] though the league considered altering the rule given Walton's case.[18] However, the NBA permits an interim or acting head coach to be eligible for coaching awards.[19] The Warriors extended their record start to 24–0. They were 39–4, the second-best start in league history, when Kerr resumed coaching full-time on January 22, 2016.[20] Golden State ended the season an NBA-record 73–9, and Kerr was voted the NBA Coach of the Year. The coach had Walton, who coached more games during the season than Kerr (43–39), sit next to him on the podium at the award press conference. Walton finished ninth in the voting, receiving one second-place and two third-place votes.[21] On April 29, 2016, the Lakers hired Walton to become their new head coach once the Warriors' season ended in the 2016 NBA Finals. He replaced Byron Scott.[22] In his first season with the Lakers, the team improved upon their franchise worst 17–65 record from the previous year, finishing 26–56. During the season, Mitch Kupchak and Jim Buss were replaced by Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka. Johnson and Pelinka both spoke highly of Walton and said he would remain the head coach of the team.[citation needed] The Lakers won five of their last six games of the season, bringing some momentum into the off-season.[citation needed] Walton's second season with the Lakers saw another slight improvement, as the team finished 35–47, its best record since the 2012–13 season.[citation needed] In 2018–19, the Lakers had high expectations after signing LeBron James to a four-year, $153.3 million contract.[23][24] Along with James and a core of young prospects, the front office completed the roster with veterans on one-year deals, a group that was rich in ball handlers but lacking in shooters.[24] Johnson initially preached patience during the preseason.[24] After the team started the season 2–5, Johnson reprimanded Walton and demanded immediate results.[23] The Lakers were 20–14 after a Christmas win over Golden State, but James and Rajon Rondo were injured during the game, which began a downturn from which the team never recovered, ending the season 37–45. Combined with season-ending injuries to Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram, the combination of James, Ball and Ingram played together for just 23 games, when they were 15–8. As a team, Lakers players missed over 210 games due to injuries, and Walton used more than 25 different starting lineups during the season.[24] Prior to the season finale, Johnson resigned, citing among his reasons that he wished to avoid conflict with owner Jeanie Buss, who supported Walton, while Johnson planned to fire him.[23] Days later on April 12, 2019, Walton and the Lakers agreed to mutually part ways.[24][25] The Lakers went 98–148 under Walton and missed the playoffs in all three seasons.[24] On April 14, 2019, Walton was hired by the Sacramento Kings as their head coach.[26][27] He and Kings general manager Vlade Divac had been teammates with the Lakers in 2004–05, which was Divac's final NBA season after spending six with Sacramento.[28] The Kings began the 2019–20 season 0–5 after losing forward Marvin Bagley III for weeks when he suffered a broken thumb in the closing minutes of a 29-point, season-opening loss to the Phoenix Suns. Sacramento rebounded from their slow start to win six of their next eight.[29] Walton was hired by Spectrum SportsNet (known then as Time Warner Cable SportsNet) in 2013 to join their Lakers on-air broadcast team.[30] Much like his father Bill, Walton is a fan of the Grateful Dead. On his right arm, there is a tattoo of four Grateful Dead-type dancing skeletons, each one with a basketball; the skeletons represent Luke and his three brothers. In 2006, Walton made a cameo appearance on the television soap opera The Young and the Restless.[31] In December 2008, a woman named Stacy Elizabeth Beshear pleaded no contest to charges of stalking Walton. At one point, she pulled up to Walton's car and ""pretended to fire gunshots at him with her hand."" She was sentenced to three years' probation, told to attend weekly counseling sessions for a year and ordered to stay away for three years from Walton's home and from the Lakers' games and practices.[32] In 2009, Walton and his father became the third father-son duo to both win NBA championships as players, following the Guokases (Matt Sr. and Matt Jr.) and the Barrys (Rick and Brent). Walton married long-time girlfriend Bre Ladd in 2013. The two met in 2002 at the University of Arizona, where she played volleyball on their varsity team, and started dating in 2005.[33][34] They have two children.[34] On April 22, 2019, former Spectrum SportsNet host Kelli Tennant filed a civil lawsuit against Walton, accusing him of sexual assault.[35][36] They had appeared on the network together during Walton's brief broadcasting stint. He had also written a foreword for her book, which she published in 2014. She alleged that the assault occurred afterwards, when she dropped off a copy of the book to him in a hotel in Santa Monica, California, while he was an assistant with Golden State.[37] According to Tennant, he invited her to his room, where he pinned her on the bed. He kissed her face, neck and chest and groped her breasts and groin area. She said he later rubbed his erection against her leg.[36] Walton denied the charges;[38] he acknowledged their meeting at the hotel, but wrote in court filings that ""their encounter was very short, entirely pleasant and consensual.""[39] His lawyer called her ""an opportunist, not a victim.""[36] The Kings and the NBA launched a joint investigation into her claims against Walton.[36] In August, the investigators concluded that there was ""not a sufficient basis to support"" the accusations.[40] Tennant declined to participate in the investigation.[41][42] On December 5, the lawsuit was dropped at her request, with records showing it was dismissed ""with prejudice"", meaning she cannot re-file.[39]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/315.png

A five time All-Star and three time All-NBA Second Team selection, Wanzer played his entire professional career for the Rochester Royals of the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and National Basketball Association (NBA). He won an NBA championship with the Royals in 1951. During his final two years as a player, he served as the team's player-coach. After he retired from playing in 1957, he remained as a coach with the Royals for one season, before he became the head coach of the St. John Fisher Cardinals college basketball team in 1963. He stayed in the role with the college for 24 years until his retirement in 1987. Wanzer was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1987. A 6'0"" guard, Wanzer played collegiately at Seton Hall University. After leading Seton Hall to a 16-2 record as a sophomore, Wanzer enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He made the All-Pacific Armed Forces All-Star basketball team, and participated in the occupation of Guam.[1] Wanzer was selected by the Rochester Royals in 1948.[2] Royals star Bob Davies was a Seton Hall coach and steered the star guard to the NBL contender. Initially a reserve behind Al Cervi and Red Holzman, Wanzer later teamed with Davies to form a potent backcourt for the day. The Royals were very successful from 1947–1954, and their smaller stars, like Wanzer, were considered their biggest assets. With Wanzer, Rochester won the 1950–51 National Basketball Association (NBA) title. Wanzer played his entire career with the Royals, retiring from play after the end of the 1957 season. He was a five-time All-Star with the Royals, made the All-NBA Second Team three consecutive times and, in the 1951–52 season, Wanzer became the first player to ever shoot over 90% from the free throw line in a season.[3] Wanzer served as the player-coach of the Royals for two years, and then, after the franchise moved to Cincinnati, coached for another season. His 1957–58 Cincinnati Royals team were an NBA championship contender, but injuries stopped the team short. When star Maurice Stokes was permanently injured, Wanzer moved on early the following NBA season. In 1962, Wanzer became the first coach at St. John Fisher College in Pittsford, New York. He coached there for 24 seasons and also served as the school's athletic director.[4] Wanzer died on January 23, 2016 at his home in Pittsford, New York.[1][5] Pre-deceased by his wife, Nina Penrose Wanzer and son-in-law Darrel Dupra he was survived by daughters, Mary and Beth Wanzer and son, Bobby (Nancy) Wanzer; grandchildren Jeff, Zach and Whitney Dupra, Marti and Madison Wanzer; great-granddaughter Seneca Hernandez Dupra; and sister, Marilyn (Robert) Ulrich. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1987. He is also a member of the Seton Hall College Hall of Fame, among others.

317,Earl Watson,"June 12, 1979",,"Washington in Kansas City, Kansas",UCLA,2016,2018,3,true,,"""[2]""",/coaches/watsoea01c.html,"Earl Joseph Watson Jr. (born June 12, 1979)[1] is an American professional basketball coach and former player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, where he was a four-year starter and named all-conference as a senior in the Pac-10 (now known as the Pac-12). Watson was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round of the 2001 NBA draft with the 39th overall selection. He played 13 seasons in the NBA with seven teams before becoming a coach in 2014. He was the head coach of the Phoenix Suns from 2016 to 2017. Watson is a graduate of Washington High School in Kansas City, Kansas. In his senior year of high school he averaged 23.4 points, 8.3 assists and 14 rebounds per game.[2] Watson was a starter in college at UCLA, at one point playing alongside future NBA All-Star Baron Davis. They were the first two freshmen to start at UCLA since the 1979 season. A four-year starter, Watson started the most consecutive games in the history of UCLA basketball.[2] As a senior in 2000–01, he averaged 14.7 points (2nd on the team, 9th in the pac-10), 5.2 assists, (1st on the team, 2nd most in the Pac-10) 3.7 rebounds, 0.3 blocks, and 1.9 steals (most in the Pac-10, most on the team) per game. He earned first-team All-Pac-10 honors. Watson was selected in the second round (39th overall) by the SuperSonics in the 2001 NBA draft. In the 2007–08 NBA season, Watson averaged 10.7 points and 6.8 assists with the Sonics. On February 6, 2008, Watson recorded his first-ever triple-double in a game against the Sacramento Kings. Watson logged 23 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in 32 minutes.[3] It was Seattle's first triple-double since Ray Allen registered one on January 28, 2004, against the Los Angeles Lakers.[3] On July 17, 2009, Watson was waived by the Thunder.[4] He signed a one-year deal with the Indiana Pacers on July 28, 2009.[5] He signed with the Utah Jazz on September 26, 2010.[6] On July 10, 2013, he signed with the Portland Trail Blazers.[7] Watson retired as a player on October 2, 2014. On October 2, 2014, Watson was hired as an assistant coach by the Austin Spurs of the NBA D-League, effectively ending his 13-year playing career.[8] He joined the Phoenix Suns as their new assistant coach on July 30, 2015.[9][10] However, after a poor start to the 2015–16 season, the Suns fired coach Jeff Hornacek and replaced him with Watson as the interim head coach for the rest of the season.[11] While Watson would make his coaching debut on February 2, 2016 at home against the Toronto Raptors, it wouldn't be until February 27, almost a month later, where he'd record his first win with the Suns at home against the Memphis Grizzlies, a team he had previously played under. He would then get his first two-game winning streak on the road as a coach with victories on March 4 against the Orlando Magic and March 6 against the Grizzlies, respectively. After starting out the season with only one victory in ten games for February, he'd end the season with an 8–15 record the rest of the way, including ending the season with a 3–1 stint. On April 19, the Suns announced that they had agreed to a three-year deal with Watson due to the positive nature he had that was instilled upon the team after he was first hired, making him the full-time head coach of the team. At the time of his promotion to permanent head coach, Watson was the second-youngest head coach in the NBA (behind only Luke Walton), being 36 when he first started coaching.[12] Watson also became the first former UCLA Bruins player to become a head coach in the NBA, as well as the first NBA head coach of Hispanic descent.[13] During Watson's first full season as head coach, he continued to promote the same philosophical mindset he had for the Suns back when he first started coaching them, but he'd also adjust the team's focus to being more involved with defense first and then offense second.[14][15] After the Suns got off to a 0–3 start to the 2017–18 season, with two blowouts (including the worst loss in franchise history and worst season opening performance in NBA history), Watson was fired on October 22,[16] and replaced on an interim basis by associate head coach Jay Triano for the rest of the season. Watson's father, Earl, is African-American and his mother, Estella, is Mexican-American. Because his maternal grandparents were born in Mexico, Watson was eligible to play for the Mexico national basketball team.[17][18] Watson has four brothers and one sister.[1] He is also involved with the local Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Arizona.[13] One of his brothers, Dwayne, was a retired police officer who died due to blood clots in his legs that were dislodged during an altercation. The assailant, Tremaine Quinn, was sentenced to 36 months of probation for the action.[19] That incident would be a major driving force for Earl to take up coaching in basketball.[20] Watson founded the organization ""Emagine"" to positively impact the youth of his hometown Kansas City, Kansas.[21] On May 16, 2009 he married[22] actress Jennifer Freeman.[23] They have a daughter together.[24] In August 2010, they separated and their divorce was finalized in 2015. In August 2018, Watson became engaged to radio personality and television host Joy Taylor.[25] The couple split up and called off the engagement in November 2019.[citation needed] Watson has stated he takes coaching inspiration from UCLA all-time great John Wooden.[13] Watson is considered a supporter of the Amateur Athletic Union programs, saying that the right program and right people involved can lead towards more positive experiences for the people involved. He also stated that he likely would have never gotten a scholarship for UCLA if he didn't have the AAU around.[26] That kind of support would ultimately help lead him to join LaVar Ball's Junior Basketball Association committee.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/317.png

The NBA's Philadelphia 76ers selected Weiss in the 1965 NBA Draft. Weiss interspersed his career with the 76ers with a short stint in the Eastern Professional Basketball League, playing for the Wilmington Blue Bombers. He led the EBL in assists in the 1966–67 season and was named to the EBL All-Star First Team.[1] Weiss was a member of the 76ers' 1967 championship team, after which he was taken by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1967 NBA Expansion Draft.[2] Weiss played in the NBA for twelve seasons, including six with the Chicago Bulls. After retiring as a player in 1977, Weiss briefly worked for an investment firm in Anaheim, California. In 1978, he joined the San Diego Clippers as an assistant coach.[3] In 1980, he moved to the Dallas Mavericks, an expansion franchise. After six years in Dallas, Weiss accepted his first head coaching job in 1986 with the San Antonio Spurs. He coached the Spurs for two seasons, never posting a winning record. He did, however, lead them to the playoffs in 1988. After one year as an assistant with the Orlando Magic, Weiss moved to the Atlanta Hawks as head coach. In three seasons, his Hawks teams posted a record of 124–122 and made the playoffs twice. Weiss left the Hawks in 1993.

During his active career West played professionally for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). His nicknames included Mr. Clutch, for his ability to make a big play in a clutch situation, such as his famous buzzer-beating 60-foot shot that tied Game 3 of the 1970 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks; The Logo, in reference to his silhouette being incorporated into the NBA logo; Mr. Outside, in reference to his perimeter play with the Los Angeles Lakers; and Zeke from Cabin Creek, for the creek near his birthplace of Chelyan, West Virginia. West played the small forward position early in his career, and he was a standout at East Bank High School and at West Virginia University, where he led the Mountaineers to the 1959 NCAA championship game. He earned the NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player honor despite the loss. He then embarked on a 14-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, and was the co-captain of the 1960 U.S. Olympic gold medal team, a squad that was inducted as a unit into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. West's NBA career was highly successful. Playing the guard position, he was voted 12 times into the All-NBA First and Second Teams, was elected into the NBA All-Star Team 14 times, and was chosen as the All-Star MVP in 1972, the same year that he won the only title of his career. West holds the NBA record for the highest points per game average in a playoff series with 46.3. He was also a member of the first five NBA All-Defensive Teams (one second, followed by four firsts), which were introduced when he was 32 years old. Having played in nine NBA Finals, he is also the only player in NBA history to be named Finals MVP despite being on the losing team (1969). West was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1980 and voted as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA history in 1996. After his playing career ended, West took over as head coach of the Lakers for three years. He led Los Angeles into the playoffs each year and earned a Western Conference Finals berth once. Working as a player-scout for three years, West was named general manager of the Lakers prior to the 1982–83 NBA season. Under his reign, Los Angeles won six championship rings. In 2002, West became general manager of the Memphis Grizzlies and helped the franchise win their first-ever playoff berths. For his contributions, West won the NBA Executive of the Year Award twice, once as a Lakers manager (1995) and then as a Grizzlies manager (2004). West's son, Jonnie, played college basketball for West Virginia. West was born into a poor household in Chelyan, West Virginia.[5] He was the fifth of six children of Cecil Sue West, a housewife, and Howard Stewart West, a coal mine electrician.[6] West's father physically abused him, and West has stated that for a time he slept with a loaded shotgun under his bed out of fear that he might have to kill his father in self-defense.[7] West was an outgoing and aggressive child in his youth. However, in 1951 his older brother, David, was killed in action in the Korean War, and the trauma turned West into a shy and introverted boy.[5][8] He was so small, frail, and weak that he needed lots of vitamin injections from his doctor and was kept apart from children's sports, to prevent him from getting seriously injured.[5] Growing up, West spent his days hunting and fishing, but his main activity was shooting at a basketball hoop that a neighbor had nailed to his storage shed. West spent days shooting baskets from every possible angle, ignoring mud and snow in the backyard, as well as his mother's whippings when he came home hours late for dinner; he played so often that the NBA acknowledged it as ""obsessive"".[5] West attended East Bank High School in East Bank, West Virginia from 1952 to 1956. During his first year, he was benched by his coach Duke Shaver due to his lack of height. Shaver emphasized the importance of conditioning and defense, which were lessons that the teenager appreciated.[9] West soon became the captain of the freshman team, and during the summer of 1953 he grew to 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m).[5] West eventually became the team's starting small forward, and he quickly established himself as one of the finest West Virginia high school players of his generation. He was named All-State from 1953–56, then All-American in 1956 when he was West Virginia Player of the Year, becoming the state's first high-school player to score more than 900 points in a season, with an average of 32.2 points per game. West's mid-range jump shot became his trademark and he often used it to score while under pressure from opposing defenses.[5] West led East Bank to a state championship on March 24 that year, prompting East Bank High School to change its name to ""West Bank High School"" every year on March 24 in honor of their basketball prodigy. This practice remained in effect until the school closed in 1999.[10] West graduated from East Bank High School in 1956, and more than 60 universities showed interest in him. He eventually chose to stay in his home state and attend West Virginia University (WVU), located in Morgantown.[11] In his freshman year (1956–57), West was a member of the WVU freshman squad that achieved a perfect record of 17 wins without a loss over the course of the season;[11] other team members included Jay Jacobs and Willie Akers.[12] In his first varsity year under head coach Fred Schaus, West scored 17.8 points per game and averaged 11.1 rebounds; he also started in all 28 games while shooting 49.6% from the field and 73.2% from the free throw line.[13] These performances earned him a multitude of honors, among them an All-American Third Team call-up; First Team All-Southern Conference; Southern Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player Award and First Team honors; Chuck Taylor–Converse Second-team All-American honors; and Associated Press and United Press International Third-team All-American honors.[14] The Mountaineers went 26–2 that year, ending the season with a loss to Manhattan College in post-season tournament play.[15] During his junior year (1958–59), West scored 26.6 points per game and grabbed 12.3 rebounds per game.[13] He tied the NCAA five-game tournament record of 160 points (32.0 points per game) and led all scorers and rebounders in every West Virginia game, including getting 28 points and 11 rebounds in a 71–70 loss to California in the final. West was named Most Outstanding Player of that year's Final Four.[10] Further awards were All-American, Southern Conference Tournament MVP and Southern Conference Player of the Year and Athlete of the Year.[14] He was also named to be a member of the U.S. Pan American Games basketball team that won the gold medal.[5] West demonstrated his tenacity for the game in a match against the Kentucky Wildcats. He broke his nose during an incident in the game, but he continued to play despite intense pain and having to breathe through his mouth. He scored 19 points in the second-half, leading WVU to an upset victory.[10] In his final collegiate season (1959–60) West enjoyed several career highs, such as scoring 29.3 points per game, a 134 season-assists, 16.5 rebounds per game, and a shooting average of 50.4% from the field, 76.6% from the free throw line.[13] He was honored again with several awards: a call-up to the All-American selection, and being voted Southern Conference MVP.[14] West's best performance was a game against Virginia, in which he grabbed 16 rebounds and scored 40 points. Moreover, during that final year, he had 30 double-doubles and fifteen 30-point games.[16] In his collegiate career, West totaled 2,309 points and 1,240 rebounds. He averaged 24.8 points per game and 13.3 rebounds.[13] As of 2011, West holds 12 WVU all-time records.[17] West and Oscar Robertson co-captained the U.S. men's basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics.[5] West made himself available for the 1960 NBA draft, and he was drafted with the second overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers, shortly before the team relocated to Los Angeles. West became the first draft pick ever of the relocated franchise.[18] His college coach was also hired to coach the Lakers. He played West as a guard, in contrast to West's college days as a forward.[5] The Lakers were captained by Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor, who was complemented by centers Jim Krebs and Ray Felix; forwards Rudy LaRusso and Tom Hawkins; and guards Rod Hundley (from West Virginia, like West), Frank Selvy, and Bobby Leonard.[19] This team perennially had strong forwards and guards, but was constantly weak at center, giving them a disadvantage against the Boston Celtics with their Hall-of-Fame center, Bill Russell.[20] Initially, West felt odd in his new environment. He was a loner. His high-pitched voice earned him the nickname ""Tweety Bird"", and he spoke with such a thick Appalachian accent that his teammates also referred to him as ""Zeke from Cabin Creek"" (his nickname acknowledged his country roots, and his accent was so thick that he squeaked his nickname sheepishly – ""Zeek fr'm Cab'n Creek"").[21] However, West soon impressed his colleagues with his defensive hustle, with his vertical jump—he could reach up 16 inches above the rim when he went up—and with his work ethic, spending countless extra hours working on his game.[21] On the floor, West scored 17.6 points, grabbed 7.7 rebounds and gave 4.2 assists per game. West won Schaus's trust and, alternating with Hundley, Selvy, and Leonard, played 35 minutes per game and established himself as the Lakers' second scoring option.[13] The NBA commented that the Lakers now had a potent one-two-punch—with ""Mr. Inside"" (the low-post scorer, Baylor) and ""Mr. Outside"" (the long-distance shooter, West).[5] These performances soon earned West his first of fourteen NBA All-Star Game call-ups.[13] West helped the Lakers improve from their previous 25-win season to 36 wins as they reached the 1961 NBA Playoffs. They needed all five games to put away the Detroit Pistons; but then lost to the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, losing the final game 105–103.[22] In West's second NBA season, the Lakers could only make limited use of Baylor, who was called up by the U.S. Army Reserves and could play only 48 games.[21] On January 17, 1962, West scored a career-high 63 points in a 129-121 win over the New York Knicks.[23] However, West seamlessly took over the role of team leader and established himself as the main Lakers scorer, averaging 30.8 points, 7.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists per game, winning All-NBA First Team honors.[13] West became known especially for hitting important late-game shots, and Lakers' announcer Chick Hearn named him ""Mr. Clutch"" a handle which stuck with West for his entire career.[21] The Lakers won 54 regular season games and secured a first-round bye in the 1962 NBA Playoffs. They beat the Pistons four games to two to advance to the 1962 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. The teams split the first two games, and at the end of Game 3 in Los Angeles, West tied the game at 115. The Celtics' Sam Jones inbounded the ball at half-court with three seconds left. West stole the ball, raced upcourt, and converted a running layup as the buzzer sounded.[24] The Celtics tied the series in Game 6 at three games apiece, and the teams headed to Boston for Game 7. For most of the game, the Lakers trailed, but West and Frank Selvy hit several clutch baskets and tied the game at 100. Selvy then missed an open 8-foot shot which would have won the Lakers their first title. Baylor's tip-in attempt was thwarted by Sam Jones.[24] In overtime, Jones scored several clutch baskets to ensure a 110–107 win for the Celtics. The 1962 NBA finals would serve as the beginning of the greatest rivalry in NBA history[24] In the 1962–63 NBA season, Baylor was back full-time. West averaged 27.8 points, 7.0 rebounds and 5.6 assists and was again NBA All-Star and All-NBA First-Team;[13] however, he played in only 55 regular season games, missing the last seven weeks due to a hamstring injury.[20] Again, the Lakers reached the finals, and again, they battled the Celtics. With West not yet in shape, Baylor and the Lakers fell back 3–2; then they succumbed in Game 6 in front of their home crowd with a 112–109 loss. As the game ended, veteran Celtics playmaker Bob Cousy threw the ball high into the rafters of the L.A. Sports Arena.[25] In the following 1963–64 NBA season, West became the Lakers' scoring leader for the first time. His 28.7 points per game eclipsed the 25.4 by Baylor, who stated that he suffered from knee problems.[26] The Lakers struggled during the entire season, winning only 42 games, and were beaten by the Hawks in five games during the first round of the 1964 NBA Playoffs.[27] In the following 1964–65 NBA season, West averaged 31.0 points (at the time, a career-high), only surpassed by perennial scoring champion Wilt Chamberlain.[13] After ending the regular season with 49 wins, L.A. played the Baltimore Bullets in the first round of the 1965 NBA Playoffs, but then team captain Baylor suffered a career-threatening knee injury.[26] West spectacularly took over Baylor's leader role, as he scored 49 points and willed the shocked Lakers to the win. In Game 2, Baltimore was unable to stop the Lakers guard, who scored 52 points, nearly half of L.A.'s total, in the 118–115 win.[28] The Bullets took their two home games, despite West scoring 44 and 48 points respectively, but in the decisive Game 5 in L.A., the guard helped beat the Bullets with 42 points in a close 117–115 win. West averaged 46.3 points per game, a figure that is still an NBA record.[29] However, in the 1965 NBA Finals, the Celtics easily beat the short-handed Lakers, 4–1. In Game 1, which Boston easily won, defensive Celtics guard K. C. Jones kept West to only 26 points, and in Game 2, West scored 45 points, but Boston still won 129–123.[30] In Game 3, West scored 49 points, and L.A. finally won a game, but in Games 4 and 5, the Lakers were beaten by double digits; in the last quarter of Game 5, West missed 14 of 15 shots and could not prevent yet another Celtics win.[30] Still, the Lakers guard finished the playoffs with 40.6 points per game.[20] In the 1965–66 NBA season, West averaged a career-best 31.3 points, along with 7.1 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game. He made an NBA record 840 free throws, and earned yet another pair of All-Star Team and All-NBA First Team nominations.[13] Winning 45 games, the Lakers beat the St. Louis Hawks in a close seven-game series, and yet again met the Boston Celtics in the 1966 NBA Finals. West was assisted by Baylor, who was a self-estimated ""75 percent"" of his pre-injury self,[31] The two long-standing rivals split the first six games, with West's usual scoring dominance countered by Celtics forward John Havlicek, whose size and speed created serious mismatch problems for the Lakers.[31] In Game 7, West and Baylor shot a combined three of 18 in the first half, and the Lakers fell far behind; L.A. willed themselves back to a close 95–93 with four seconds left, but the Celtics ran the clock out and the Lakers were denied yet again.[31] The 1966–67 NBA season saw West playing only 66 regular-season games due to injury;[20] his averages fell slightly to 28.0 points, 5.9 rebounds and 6.8 assists per game.[13] The Lakers had a disappointing season, winning only 36 games and getting swept by the San Francisco Warriors in the first round of the 1967 NBA Playoffs.[32] Veteran coach Fred Schaus retired, and Butch Van Breda Kolff took over; under his reign, the Lakers won 52 games in the 1967–68 NBA season in their first season in The Forum.[33] The 52 wins were accumulated despite West playing only 51 regular season games due to injury[20] and scoring 26.3 points, the lowest average since his rookie year: after being a First-Teamer for six times en bloc, he only made the All-NBA Second Team.[13] In the 1968 NBA Playoffs, the Lakers beat the Chicago Bulls and the Warriors to set up yet another Lakers-Celtics NBA Finals; it was considered a match of size versus speed, as the Lakers had nobody to guard Celtics coach/center Bill Russell or forward John Havlicek close to the basket, but the Celtics in return had difficulties guarding prolific L.A. outside shooters Baylor, West and fellow guard Gail Goodrich.[34] In Game 1, West only hit seven of 24 shots, and the Lakers lost 107–101, but L.A. evened out the series at two games each. But West, who had scored 38 points in a Game 4 win, had sprained his ankle and did not play at full strength the rest of the series.[34] In Game 5, an injured West scored 35 points, but Boston won by three points. In Game 6, Havlicek shredded the Lakers with 40 points, and after yet another Finals loss to Boston, West commented that the Lakers lost two games they should have won: ""We gave them the first game, and we gave them the fifth. But I take nothing from them… They're all that way on the Celtics, and you can't teach it.""[34] On July 9, 1968, the Lakers made a trade that brought reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia 76ers to Los Angeles at the beginning of the 1968–69 NBA season. To get the center, the Lakers traded West's backcourt partner Archie Clark, starting center Darrall Imhoff and backup forward Jerry Chambers to Philadelphia.[35] Coach Van Breda Kolff was concerned about the drain at the guard positions after losing Clark, and especially after losing Goodrich in the expansion draft to the Phoenix Suns. He only had diminutive, defensively weak Johnny Egan left next to West.[35] While West himself got on well with the new recruit, Chamberlain often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor and had a poor relationship with Van Breda Kolff. Van Breda Kolff pejoratively called Chamberlain ""The Load"", and later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his own statistics.[36] In return, the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as ""the dumbest and worst coach ever"".[36] There was an altercation in which Chamberlain was about to punch Van Breda Kolff before Baylor had intervened.[37] West was clearly disturbed by locker room tension; used to playing on teams with good chemistry, his quality of play became erratic, and his scoring average of 25.9 points was his lowest since his rookie season. However, he made the Second Team of the inaugural All-Defensive Team.[37] In the 1969 NBA Playoffs, the 55-win Lakers defeated the Atlanta Hawks and the San Francisco Warriors, setting up the sixth finals series versus Boston in eight years. Prior to Game 1, West privately complained to Bill Russell of exhaustion, but then the Lakers guard scored 53 points on Boston in a close two-point win.[38] L.A. also took Game 2, with West scoring 41 points.[39] In Game 3, Russell opted to double-team West, and the guard's exhaustion began to show: West twice asked to be subbed for longer periods, and both times the Lakers fell back by double digits and finally lost by six points.[38] Game 4 saw Celtics guard Sam Jones hit an off-balance buzzer beater to tie the series,[39] but in Game 5, the Lakers struck back and won by 13 points; however, they suffered a major blow when West – who scored 39 points and by far led all players in scoring during the entire series – lunged for a meaningless late-game ball and seriously pulled his hamstring: it was immediately visible that the injury would not heal until the end of the series.[38] A limping West scored 26 points in Game 6, but the Celtics won 99–90 with a strong Bill Russell, who held Chamberlain to only eight points in the entire game.[39] In Game 7, Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had put up thousands of balloons in the rafters of the Forum in Los Angeles. This display of arrogance motivated the Celtics and angered West.[35] The Lakers trailed the entire game and were behind 91-76 after 3 quarters, but powered by a limping West, the Lakers closed the gap to 103-102 with two minutes to go and had the ball. But West committed costly turnovers and L.A. lost the game 108–106 despite a triple-double of 42 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists from West, who became the only recipient of the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award from the losing team.[39] After the loss, West was seen as the ultimate tragic hero: after the game, Bill Russell held his hand, and John Havlicek said: ""I love you, Jerry"".[38] In the 1969–70 NBA season under new coach Joe Mullaney, the Lakers' season began with a shock when Wilt Chamberlain seriously injured his knee and missed practically the whole regular season.[40] As after Baylor's injury years before, West stepped into the void, leading the NBA in scoring average with 31.2 points per game, and averaging 4.6 rebounds and 7.5 assists per game, earning him his first of four All-Defensive First Team vote and another All-NBA First Team berth after two Second Team years.[13] The Lakers won 46 games, and in the 1970 NBA Playoffs, they narrowly beat the Phoenix Suns in seven games and swept the Hawks in four, setting up the first NBA Finals between the Lakers and the rugged New York Knicks, led by Hall-of-Famers, such as Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt Frazier.[41] L.A. and N.Y. split the first two games, with both games respectively decided by centers Reed and the still-hobbling Chamberlain.[41] In Game 3, DeBusschere hit a mid-range jump shot with three seconds left to put the Knicks ahead 102–100, and the Lakers had no time-outs left. Chamberlain inbounded the ball to West, who raced past Walt Frazier and threw up a 60-foot shot. Frazier later commented: ""The man's crazy. He looks determined. He thinks it's really going in!""[5] West incredibly connected, and this basket was later called one of the greatest moments ever by the NBA.[42] As the three-point line had not been introduced yet, the shot just tied the game. In overtime, West however sprained his left hand and missed all five of his shots, and the Knicks won 111-108.[10] In Game 4, the guard scored 37 points and 18 assists, and the Lakers won.[43] However, more frustration awaited West in Game 5, when Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed out for the series; instead of capitalising on a double-digit lead and reeling off an easy win, the Lakers committed 19 second half turnovers, and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times, respectively, in the entire second half and lost 107-100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history.[41][43] After Chamberlain scored 45 points and West 31 points plus 13 assists in a series-equalising 135-113 Lakers win, the Lakers seemed favorites prior to Game 7. However, West had also injured his right hand and received several manual injections,[41] and Reed famously hobbled up court prior to Game 7: the Knicks center scored the first four points, and inspired his team to one of the most famous playoff upsets of all time.[44] With his injured hands, West still hit nine of his 19 shots, but was outplayed by Walt Frazier, who scored 36 points and 19 assists and was credited with several crucial steals on Lakers guard Dick Garrett.[41][43] In the 1970–71 NBA season, the Lakers resigned Gail Goodrich, who came back from the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968. At age 32, West averaged 26.9 points, 4.6 rebounds and 9.5 assists,[13] and helped the Lakers win 46 games and make the 1971 NBA Playoffs. After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, West himself injured his knee and was out for the season; the short-handed Lakers lost the Western Conference Finals in five games to the championship-bound Milwaukee Bucks, who were led by freshly-crowned Most Valuable Player Lew Alcindor (later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson.[45] Prior to the 1971–72 NBA season, West was smarting from his frequent injuries and losses and considered retirement.[5] The Lakers hired former Celtics star guard and future Hall-of-Fame coach Bill Sharman as head coach. Although injured captain Elgin Baylor ended his career, the Lakers had a season for the ages. The team was powered by Sharman's emphasis on tough defense and fast break offense, and L.A. embarked on an unprecedented 33 game win streak, en route to a then-record 69 wins in the regular season.[46] West himself contributed with 25.8 points and led the league with a career-high 9.7 assists per game. He was named All-Star, All-NBA and All-Defense First Teamer and voted 1972 All-Star Game MVP.[13] In the post-season, the Lakers defeated the Chicago Bulls in a four-game sweep,[47] then went on to face the Milwaukee Bucks, and defeated them in six games. In the 1972 NBA Finals, the Lakers again met the New York Knicks. Although West suffered a terrible shooting slump during Games 1 and 2, the Lakers tied the series at one win each, and in Game 3, he scored 21 points and helped L.A. win Game 3. In this game, he now had scored 4,002 playoff points, which set an all-time NBA record.[48] After winning Game 4 due to a superb outing from Wilt Chamberlain, West scored 23 points and dished out 9 assists in Game 5, thus he won the game. With that, West won his first-ever NBA title.[48][49] West conceded that he had played a terrible series, and credited the team for the success. Years later he said ""I played terrible basketball in the Finals, and we won… It was particularly frustrating because I was playing so poorly that the team overcame me. Maybe that's what a team is all about.""[46] Having vanquished this long-time bane, West entered his 13th NBA year. In the 1972–73 NBA season, the main scoring role was taken by Goodrich, and West was now a playmaker instead of a scorer. However, West averaged 22.8 points, but also averaged 8.8 assists per game, and again was a First Teamer in the All-Star, All-NBA, and All-Defense Teams.[13] The Lakers won 60 games and reached the 1973 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks. In Game 1 West scored 24 points before fouling out with three minutes left and L.A. won Game 1 115–112.[50] However, the Knicks took Games 2 and 3, and West strained both of his hamstrings: in Game 4, the shorthanded Lakers were no match for New York, and in Game 5, the valiant, but injured West and Hairston had miserable games, and despite Chamberlain scoring 23 points and grabbing 21 rebounds, the Lakers lost 102–93 and the series.[51][52] The 1973–74 NBA season was to be West's last as a player. Now 36 years old, the veteran guard averaged 20.3 points, 3.7 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game.[13] In two newly introduced statistics, steals and blocks, he was credited with 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per game. Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin,[5] West was still regarded as an elite guard, earning another callup into his final All-Star Game.[13] Without Chamberlain, who had ended his NBA career, the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks. After this loss, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.[53] West wanted to re-negotiate his contract and keep playing, however he said Cooke ""basically told my agent to go to hell. I felt I was deceived. When you feel that you're deceived you don't want any part of the organization that deceived you. I could've played another very good year. Every athlete says that. But I could've, and I knew I could've. But I could never have played for the Lakers again, and I wasn't going to play for anybody else.""[54] At the time of his departure, West had scored more points than any other Laker in franchise history.[20] Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke was known for having a keen eye identifying leadership and teaching qualities (he also gave Hall of Famers Sparky Anderson and Joe Gibbs their first managerial/head coaching positions),[55] and asked West to coach and participate in player personnel decisions.[56] In the 1976–77 season, West became coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. In three years, he led the Lakers and star center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to a 145–101 record, making the playoffs in all 3 seasons and reaching the Western Conference Finals once in 1977.[57] After his coaching stint, he worked as a scout for three years before becoming general manager of the Lakers prior to the 1982–83 season. NBA.com credits West in creating the great 1980s Lakers dynasty, which brought five championship rings (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988) to Los Angeles.[5] After a slump in the early 1990s, West rebuilt the team of coach Del Harris around center Vlade Divac, forward Cedric Ceballos, and guard Nick Van Exel, which won 48 games, and went to the Western Conference Semifinals; for turning the team around, West received his first Executive of the Year Award.[58] By trading Vlade Divac for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant, signing free agent center Shaquille O'Neal, and signing six-time NBA champion Phil Jackson as a coach, West laid down the foundation of the Lakers three-peat which saw L.A. win three NBA titles from 2000 to 2002.[5] In 2002, West became general manager of the Memphis Grizzlies. He explained his decision with the desire for exploring something new: ""After being a part of the Lakers success for so many years, I have always wondered how it would be to build a winning franchise that has not experienced much success. I want to help make a difference.""[59] West's Memphis stint was not as spectacular as his Los Angeles stint, but he turned a franchise which was about to be sold into a reliable playoffs team, making few trades but getting the maximum from the players he had available (such as Pau Gasol, James Posey and Jason Williams) and signing coach Hubie Brown, who became Coach of the Year in 2004.[60] West himself won his second NBA Executive of the Year Award in the same year.[58] At age 69, West retired as a Grizzlies general manager in 2007 and turned over managing duties to Chris Wallace, from Buckhannon, West Virginia.[60] On May 19, 2011, West joined the Golden State Warriors as an executive board member, reporting directly to new owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber.[61][62] This role also came with an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the team.[63] In 2015, the Warriors won their first championship in 40 years; the championship was the seventh earned by West while serving as a team executive. He earned his eighth in the 2016-2017 season. On June 14, 2017, West announced that he would go to the Los Angeles Clippers as an executive board member.[64][65] West was an all-around combo guard who could take the playmaking roles of a point guard and score like a shooting guard, while being equally strong on offense and on defense.[5] He had a jump shot with a release the NBA lauded as ""lightning quick"", and was known for making baskets late in the game, earning him the nickname ""Mr. Clutch"".[5] Having played forward early in his career, West was also a capable rebounder, and gifted with long arms, quick hands and strong defensive instincts, West was also once described as one of the best ball hawks, man-to-man defenders and shot blockers among NBA guards:[21] when the All-Defensive Teams were introduced in 1969, West made every one of them until his career ended in 1974.[13] ""He stole more than anybody, although they didn't keep records on it then"", said Sharman.[66] However, contemporaries were most impressed by West's work ethic, obsessively practicing and shooting and rarely being satisfied with himself.[21] West's all-round game and attitude is maybe best expressed in his statistically most spectacular game: he once was credited with 44 points (16 of 17 shots from the field, 12 of 12 free throw attempts) with 12 rebounds, 12 assists, and (unofficially counted) 10 blocked shots, thus scoring a non-official ultra-rare quadruple double.[5] Instead of being proud, West merely commented: ""Defensively, from a team standpoint, I didn't feel I played very well. Very rarely was I satisfied with how I played.""[5] West ended his playing career with 14 All-Star, 12 All-NBA Team and five All-Defensive Team selections, and scored 25,192 points, 6,238 assists and 5,366 rebounds in 932 games, translating to an average of 27.0 points, 6.7 assists and 5.8 rebounds per game.[13] Among retired players, only Michael Jordan, Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain surpass his 27.0 points per game average.[5] He led the Lakers in scoring in seven seasons,[18] only Jordan had a higher career scoring average in the playoffs (33.5 versus 29.1).[67] In 1979, West was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and the Lakers retired his No. 44 jersey in 1983.[18] In March 2008, ESPN voted West the third greatest shooting guard of all time.[68] As a coach, West led the Lakers into three consecutive playoff campaigns, and then went on to win seven NBA championships as a general manager, building the 1980s Lakers dynasty under coach Pat Riley and players Magic Johnson, Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy and the 2000s under coach Phil Jackson and players Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.[5] In the summer of 2000, the city of Morgantown, West Virginia, and West Virginia Governor Cecil Underwood, dedicated the road outside of the West Virginia University Coliseum, ""Jerry West Boulevard"". The same road is shared on the south end of Morgantown with Don Knotts Boulevard, in honor of another WVU alumnus.[69] Also, on November 26, 2005, his number 44 became the first basketball number to be retired by West Virginia University and on February 17, 2007, a bronze statue of him was honored outside of the WVU Coliseum.[70] On February 17, 2011, a Jerry West statue was unveiled outside Staples Center at the Star Plaza in Los Angeles, California.[71] Finally, the NBA logo itself is modeled after West's silhouette.[72] On June 1, 2019, President Donald Trump announced West would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[73] West married his college sweetheart Martha Jane Kane in April 1960 in Morgantown;[74] they divorced in 1976.[10] They have three sons, David, Mark and Michael.[59] Jerry married his current wife Karen in 1978. They have two sons, Ryan and Jonnie.[10][59] Jonnie played guard for West's college team, the West Virginia Mountaineers and married professional golfer Michelle Wie in 2019.[75] As a person, West was often described as an introverted and nervous character, but who also drew highest praise for his uncompromising work ethic. Regarding his shyness, WVU roommate Jody Gardner testified that West never dated in his entire freshman year, and Lakers coach Fred Schaus once recalled a two-week period when his guard never said a word.[76] Apart from being shy, West was always restless: Schaus described him as a ""bundle of nerves"", Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy as ""always on the move"", and fellow Laker and Mountaineer Rod Hundley testified that during bar visits, West would quickly squirm and demand to go elsewhere before everybody else had settled.[77] His first wife Martha Kane recalled that her husband often had difficulties opening up to her. After a big loss, the Wests would drive home and she would try to console him, but West would say ""get out"" at the home porch and drive away—an experience that ""killed"" her as a wife.[78] Early in his career, West's West Virginian roots made him target for some mild jeering. He spoke with a high pitched voice that became even shriller when he became excited, so that Lakers captain Elgin Baylor dubbed West ""Tweety Bird"".[21] His Appalachian accent was so thick that one coach interrupted him and asked him to speak English.[21] Baylor once commented: ""Rumors are safe with you, Tweety Bird. You pass them on, but nobody can understand you.""[76] West was also regarded for his extreme mental toughness and his exemplary work ethic. The NBA described West as ""obsessive perfectionism, unabashed confidence, and an uncompromising will to win… a level of intensity so high it could melt lead"".[5] Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn once said: ""He took a loss harder than any player I've ever known. He would sit by himself and stare into space. A loss just ripped his guts out.""[5] Even before his sole championship in 1972, the Lakers held a ""Jerry West Night"", and eleven-time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said: ""Jerry, you are, in every sense of the word, truly a champion… If I could have one wish granted, it would be that you would always be happy.""[79] In 2011, West and bestselling author Jonathan Coleman wrote a memoir entitled West by West: My Charmed, Tormented Life. The book has had tremendous critical acclaim and became an instant New York Times bestseller. During an interview on HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel, West revealed that as a child he was the victim of physical abuse from his father and has suffered from depression ever since.[80][81]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/319.png

He has previously been a head coach for three National Basketball Association (NBA) teams and an assistant for four others, and has also coached in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), American Basketball Association (ABA) and Japan Basketball League (JBL). He won titles in both the NBA and WNBA, and is also remembered as the coach of the Loyola Marymount University (LMU) men's basketball team during that school's era of greatest basketball glory. Westhead is known for an unorthodox, run-and-gun style called ""The System."" He attended Saint Joseph's University. Westhead started his coaching career at Cheltenham High School in suburban Philadelphia; in 1968, he coached the Panthers to a loss in the Pennsylvania state championship.[1] One of his players at Cheltenham was future University of Virginia Athletic Director Craig Littlepage.[2] Westhead coached the La Salle University men's basketball team starting in 1970. Westhead led the Explorers to one NIT and two NCAA tournament appearances in nine seasons (1970–1979). He finished with a record of 142–105. Westhead started his NBA head coaching career by succeeding Jack McKinney as the coach of the Los Angeles Lakers after serving briefly as an assistant to McKinney (Westhead initially became interim head coach after McKinney was hospitalized due to a serious bicycle accident). With rookie guard Magic Johnson and longtime star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the Lakers won the 1980 NBA Finals in Westhead's first year as coach, defeating Philadelphia in six games for the first title in their Showtime era. However, the team lost in the playoffs the next year to the Moses Malone-led Houston Rockets. Westhead was fired early in his third season with the Lakers, and replaced with Pat Riley (whom Westhead had hired as an assistant). It is commonly believed that Magic Johnson orchestrated Westhead's ouster. A 1987 book called Winnin' Times (about the Los Angeles Lakers' franchise history) indicated that the Lakers' owner Jerry Buss wanted to fire Westhead several days prior to the actual occurrence, which is not mutually exclusive of the notion that Johnson had orchestrated it. In 1982, Buss said ""The irony, which makes what Magic did unfortunate, is that I had already decided to fire him. But I don't think anyone will ever totally believe that.""[1] . Westhead finished his Lakers stint with a 111-50 record. Westhead was the head coach of the Chicago Bulls for the 1982–83 season, but lasted only one season as the Bulls went 28–54. Prior to that season, the Bulls traded away all-star center Artis Gilmore to the San Antonio Spurs, and the franchise was still two years away from the debut of Michael Jordan. Westhead returned to the college ranks, and took over as the head coach of the Loyola Marymount Lions men's basketball program. From 1985–1990, Westhead oversaw an impressive run in which Loyola Marymount, despite being a smaller school and not a traditional NCAA basketball power, became a legitimate contender in NCAA hoops. Westhead lured star players like Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble, who both transferred from USC, and rewrote many NCAA record books with Loyola Marymount's famous, up-tempo, run-and-gun style. From 1988 to 1990, Westhead's teams went 27–3, 20–10 and 23–5 respectively, earning NCAA tournament berths each year. Gathers led the NCAA in scoring and rebounding (32.7 ppg, 13.7 rpg) in 1989 and Kimble led the NCAA in scoring in 1990 (35.3 ppg). After the on-court death of Gathers in its conference tournament, LMU went on an inspired run in the NCAA tournament in 1990 that captured the attention of the entire college basketball world for those weeks. The Lions blew out defending champion Michigan in the 2nd round and made it to the Regional Final round before losing to eventual champion UNLV. Westhead's teams led Division I in scoring in 1988 (110.3 points per game), 1989 (112.5), and 1990 (122.4).[3] LMU's 122.4 point per game in 1990 was still a record as of February 2019.[4] As of April 2012, Loyola Marymount held the five highest combined score games in Division I history. Four of the five occurred during Westhead's career, including a record 331 in the 181–150 win over United States International University on January 31, 1989.[5] After the 1989–1990 season, Westhead left LMU for the NBA's Denver Nuggets, a position he held for two seasons. His tenure in Denver was best known for attempting to incorporate the run-and-gun offense that worked for LMU to the NBA. However, while Denver averaged a league-best 119.9 points per game in 1990–91, it also surrendered an NBA record 130.8 points per game, including 107 points in a single half to the Phoenix Suns, which remains an NBA record. Under Westhead, the Nuggets were sometimes called the ""Enver Nuggets"" (as in no ""D"" (no defense)).[6] The next year the Nuggets drafted Dikembe Mutombo, who made the All-Star team, and played at a more conservative pace scoring just 99.7 points per game, but only improved to 24 wins. Westhead was fired from the Nuggets after two seasons after posting a combined W/L record of 44–120. Following his tenure with the Nuggets, Westhead returned to college coaching as the head coach of George Mason University from 1993–1997. This time, Westhead's run-and-gun style did not succeed at the college level, ending his tenure at Mason with a 38–70 record. Westhead was succeeded at Mason by Jim Larranaga after the 1996–1997 season. From 1997 to 1999, Westhead was an assistant coach with the Golden State Warriors under head coach P. J. Carlesimo.[7] Westhead was the head coach of the Los Angeles Stars in the inaugural season of the new ABA in 2000–2001.[8] Westhead was the head coach of the Panasonic Super Kangaroos of the Japan Basketball League from 2001–2003.[9] Westhead returned to the ABA as the head coach of Long Beach Jam in 2003. He coached the team for only one game before returning to the NBA.[10] From 2003 to 2005 Westhead was an assistant coach with the Orlando Magic under head coach Johnny Davis. In 2005, Westhead was hired as the head coach of the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, a position that he held until the 2007 WNBA season concluded. In 2007, Westhead coached the Mercury to a WNBA championship, making him the only coach to win a championship in the NBA and the WNBA. The Mercury won using Westhead's fast-paced approach.[11] On September 27, 2007 he agreed to a contract with the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics to be an assistant coach under longtime friend P. J. Carlesimo. When Carlesimo was relieved of his duties on November 21, 2008, Westhead was also released as an assistant at that time.[12] On March 26, 2009 University of Oregon Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny introduced Paul Westhead as the Ducks' newest head coach. As the sixth head coach in the history of Oregon women's basketball, this was Westhead's first job as head coach of an NCAA women's program (although he had coached women's teams at the professional level before). On March 4, 2014, the University of Oregon announced that they would not renew Westhead's contract, which expired March 31, 2014. Westhead was 65-90 overall at Oregon and 27-64 in conference play in five seasons. Westhead's Oregon contract was worth more than $3 million for five years, with his final season earning him $675,000.[13]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/320.png

Westphal has had a storied career in the NBA, both as a player and as a coach. As a player, he won an NBA championship with the Boston Celtics in the 1974 NBA Finals. In addition to being a five-time All-Star selection, from 1977 to 1981, Westphal earned three All-NBA First Team selections and one Second Team honor. Later, he returned to the Finals in 1993 as head coach of the Phoenix Suns. He was also head coach of the Seattle SuperSonics and the Sacramento Kings. He returned to his home state of California when he was the men's basketball head coach at Pepperdine University from 2001 to 2006. He was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019. Westphal was born in Torrance, California. He went to Aviation High School and then USC. He was the 10th overall pick in the 1972 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. After three seasons in Boston, including a championship in 1974, he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. In 1976, Westphal helped the Suns reach their first-ever NBA Finals appearance, where they played against the Celtics. Game 5 of that series is often called ""the greatest game ever played""[1][2][3][4] in NBA history. Westphal was 6th in the NBA in scoring average for the 1977–78 season at 25.2 ppg. In that season, he became the first NBA All-Star Weekend H-O-R-S-E Competition champion. The following 1978–79 season, he was 7th in scoring average with 24.0 points per game. After the 1979–80 season, he was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics for Dennis Johnson where he played one season before heading to the New York Knicks. In 1983 he returned to Phoenix for his final NBA season. He had been injured and only played in 59 of the 82 games of his final season. In his career Westphal scored a total of 12,809 NBA points for an average of 15.6 points per game, with 3,591 assists for an average of 4.4 assists per game. He also had 1,580 rebounds, for an average of 1.9 per game. He was a 5-time All-Star and 3 times an All-NBA first team selection and one time a second team All-NBA selection. He is Phoenix's fifth all-time leading scorer (9,564), averaging 20.6 points (1975–80, 1983–84) and a member of Phoenix's Ring of Honor. Westphal was also added into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as a player on September 6, 2019. Westphal's coaching career started in 1985 with Southwestern Baptist Bible College, located in Phoenix. After compiling a 21–9 record in his lone season there, he moved on to Grand Canyon College, also in Phoenix, and after two seasons led them to the NAIA national title in 1988.[6][7] In 1988, after three years in the college ranks, Westphal became an assistant coach with the Phoenix Suns under head coach Cotton Fitzsimmons, and in 1992 he succeeded Fitzsimmons as head coach of the Suns.[6][8] With players such as Kevin Johnson, Dan Majerle, rookie Richard Dumas and the newly acquired Charles Barkley and Danny Ainge, the Suns made it to the NBA Finals in Westphal's first season as a coach, but eventually lost to the Chicago Bulls in six games. Incidentally, Game 3 between the two teams went to triple-overtime (which the Suns won) and is considered one of the greatest games ever played. While the Suns made the playoffs during each of Westphal's seasons as coach, they did not return to the Finals, and Westphal was let go during the 1995–96 season. He served as an assistant coach for a high school team in Arizona for two years before he returned to the NBA as a coach with the SuperSonics for the 1998–99 season. He coached in Seattle until he was fired during the 2000–01 season. Westphal returned to the college ranks in April 2001 at Pepperdine University. In his first season, Westphal led the Waves men's basketball team to a 22–9 record and tied nationally ranked Gonzaga for the WCC title. The team achieved an at-large berth to the NCAA Tournament, but lost 83–74 to Wake Forest in the first round in a game played at ARCO Arena. This was the only postseason berth during the rest of Westphal's five-year tenure and he finished with an overall record of 74–72. After a 7–20 season in 2005–06, Westphal was fired on March 15, 2006.[9][10] Westphal has also worked as a studio analyst for Fox Sports Net West/Prime Ticket for Los Angeles Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers games, first joining them during the Clippers' playoff run. In 2007, Westphal announced the locally broadcast USC basketball games. He worked alongside Jim Watson on FSN Prime Ticket. Westphal was also a studio analyst along with Don Maclean for the 2007 Pacific-10 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament games that aired on FSN. On June 28, 2007, the Dallas Mavericks announced they had signed Westphal as an assistant coach under head coach Avery Johnson. When Johnson was replaced by Rick Carlisle, Westphal left coaching to become executive vice-president of basketball operations (under Donnie Nelson) for the Mavericks on October 2, 2008.[11] On June 10, 2009, Westphal was named head coach of the Sacramento Kings. Westphal was fired from the Kings on January 5, 2012.[8][12] For the 2014–15 season, Westphal was hired by the Brooklyn Nets as an assistant to new head coach Lionel Hollins.[13] Hollins had previously served as Westphal's assistant coach in Phoenix. In his first season with the Brooklyn coaching staff, the Nets reached the Eastern Conference Playoffs. [14]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/321.png

He has been inducted three times into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, first in 1989 as a player, as a coach in 1998, and in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States Olympic ""Dream Team"", for which he was an assistant coach. He is also a 2006 inductee into the College Basketball Hall of Fame. Wilkens was a combined 13-time NBA All-Star as a player (nine times) and as a head coach (four times), was the 1993 NBA Coach of the Year, won the 1979 NBA Championship as the head coach of the Seattle SuperSonics, and an Olympic gold medal as the head coach of the 1996 U.S. men's basketball team. During the 1994–95 season, Wilkens set the record for most coaching wins in NBA history, a record he held when he retired with 1,332 victories. Wilkens is now second on the list behind Don Nelson, who broke it in 2010. He won the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award for the 2010–11 NBA season.[1] Wilkens is also the most prolific coach in NBA history, at 2,487 regular season games, 89 more games than Nelson, and over 400 more than any other coach, and has more losses than any other coach in NBA history, at 1,155. Wilkens grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.[2] His father was African American and his mother was Irish American.[3] Wilkens was raised in the Roman Catholic faith.[3] At Boys High School, Wilkens was a basketball teammate of longtime Major League Baseball star Tommy Davis. Wilkens was a two-time All-American (1959 and 1960) at Providence College. He led the team to their first NIT appearance in 1959, and to the NIT finals in 1960. When he graduated, Wilkens was, with 1,193 points, the second-ranked scorer in Friar history (he has since dropped to twentieth as of 2005). In 1996, Wilkens' No. 14 jersey was retired by the college, the first alumnus to receive such an honor. In honor of his collegiate accomplishments, Wilkens was one of the inaugural inductees into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. Wilkens was drafted sixth overall by the St. Louis Hawks in the 1960 NBA draft. He began his career with eight seasons with the St. Louis Hawks, who lost the finals to the Boston Celtics in his rookie season. The Hawks made the playoffs consistently with Wilkens but never again reached the finals. Wilkens placed second to Wilt Chamberlain in the 1967–1968 MVP balloting, his last with the Hawks. Wilkens was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics for Walt Hazzard and spent four seasons there. He averaged 22.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 8.2 assists per game in his first season for the SuperSonics, and was an All-Star in three of his seasons for them. He was named head coach in his second season with the team. Although the SuperSonics did not reach the playoffs while Wilkens simultaneously coached and started at point guard, their record improved each season and they won 47 games during the 1971–72 NBA season. Wilkens was dealt to the Cleveland Cavaliers before the start of the next season in a highly unpopular trade, and the SuperSonics fell to 26-56 without his leadership on the court.[4] Wilkens ended his career spending two seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers (1972–1974) and one with the Portland Trail Blazers (1974–1975). Wilkens scored 17,772 points during the regular season, was a nine-time NBA All-Star, and was named the 1971 NBA All-Star Game MVP in 1971. With Seattle, he led the league in assists in the 1969–70 season, and at the time of his retirement was the NBA's second all-time leader in that category, behind only Oscar Robertson. From 1969 to 1972 with Seattle, and in his one season as a player with Portland, he was a player-coach. He retired from playing in 1975 and was the full-time coach of the Trail Blazers for one more season. After a season off from coaching, he again became coach of the SuperSonics when he replaced Bob Hopkins who was fired 22 games into the 1977–78 season after a dismal 5-17 start. The SuperSonics won 11 of their first 12 games under Wilkens and made the playoffs in back-to-back years, losing in seven games to the Washington Bullets in the 1978 NBA Finals before returning to the 1979 NBA Finals and defeating the Washington Bullets in five games for their first and only NBA title. He coached in Seattle for eight seasons (1977–1985), winning his (and Seattle's) only NBA championship in 1979. He would go on to coach Cleveland (1986–1993), Atlanta (1993–2000), Toronto (2000–2003) and New York (2004–05). The Hall of Famer was named head coach of the New York Knicks on January 15, 2004. After the Knicks' slow start to the 2004–05 season, Wilkens resigned from the team on January 22, 2005. On November 29, 2006 he was hired as vice chairman of the Seattle SuperSonics' ownership group,[5] and was later named the Sonics' President of Basketball Operations on April 27, 2007.[6] On July 6, 2007 Wilkens resigned from the Sonics organization. Wilkens currently is seen on Northwest FSN Studio as a College Hoops analyst and occasionally appears on College Hoops Northwest at game nights.

He was an assistant to Phil Jackson on nine NBA championship teams with the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers. Winter was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011. Winter was born near Wellington, Texas (a fact which later provided him with his nickname when his family moved to California) fifteen minutes after twin sister Mona Francis. The Winter family moved to Lubbock, Texas in 1929, where his mechanic father died of an infection when Tex was ten years old. Winter had to work while in elementary school to help his family, one such job was to collect boxes for a local baker in exchange for day-old bread. In 1936, Winter and his sister moved to Huntington Park, California with their mother, who would work as a clothing store sales manager. His older football star brother Ernest remained in Texas to finish high school while his older sister Elizabeth had already married and moved to California first and encouraged them to move there. While attending Huntington Park High School, Winter worked with Phil Woolpert and Pete Newell as a ball boy for Loyola University. After graduation from high school in 1940, Winter attended college at Compton Community College in Los Angeles for two years, where he became a renowned pole vaulter and earned a scholarship to Oregon State University. He was on the basketball and track teams at both schools. As a pole vaulter, Winter competed against Bob Richards, a 1948 and 1952 olympian. He was considered a strong candidate for the US Olympic team in 1944, but the Olympics were cancelled by World War II. Winter met his wife Nancy at Oregon State. Both of them entered the United States Navy in early 1943, with Winter going into fighter pilot training and his wife into WAVES.[2] After his pilot's wings were conferred he was assigned to fighter pilot duty in the Pacific. However, his orders were rescinded after his brother's plane was shot down, and Winter remained at Naval Air Station Glenview in Illinois for the duration of the war. After the war, he was assigned to NAS Corpus Christi as a test pilot for an experimental jet craft. While in the navy, Winter was a starting guard for his basketball team under the commanding officer Chuck Taylor.[3] He left the Navy with the rank of Ensign in 1946. Winter returned to college after the war at the University of Southern California, where he learned the triangle offense from his coach Sam Barry. At USC, Winter became an All-American pole vaulter and was a teammate of Bill Sharman, Alex Hannum, and Gene Rock, future professional basketball players. After graduating college in 1947, Winter immediately entered the coaching profession as an assistant to Hall-of-Famer Jack Gardner at Kansas State University. He would work as a basketball coach for the next 61 years. In 1952, Winter began a two-year stint as head coach at Marquette University, becoming the youngest coach in major college basketball. In 1954 Winter returned to Kansas State.[4][5] Winter served as Kansas State's head coach for the following 15 years, posting a 261-118 (.689) record. He still owns the record for most league titles (eight) in school history and twice led the Wildcats to the Final Four (1958 and 1964). Winter guided K-State to postseason play seven times overall, including six trips to the NCAA Tournament, and boasts one of the highest winning percentages in K-State's history. Winter was named UPI National Coach of the Year in 1958 after he led Kansas State to the Final Four by knocking off Oscar Robertson and second-ranked Cincinnati in an 83-80 double-overtime thriller. Junior center Bob Boozer was one of three Wildcats to be named a first team All-America, along with teammates Jack Parr and Roy DeWitz. K-State advanced to their fourth Final Four in 1964. Winter's Wildcats knocked off Texas Western and Wichita State to reach Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri. Two-time Big Eight selection Willie Murrell averaged 25.3 points per game during the run, which ended in a 90-82 loss to eventual national champion UCLA. In 1962, Winter also wrote the book, entitled The Triple-Post Offense, on the triangle offense – the offense which he utilized with such success at Kansas State. Following his leaving Kansas State to his assistant Cotton Fitzsimmons, Winter also served as head coach at the University of Washington (where he was hired by then Athletic Director Joseph Kearney), Northwestern University (1973-1978), and Long Beach State. In 1982, LSU's Dale Brown, who Winter befriended when Brown was a high school coach, hired him as an assistant for one year 1983-84.[6] In 30 years as a college head coach, Winter compiled a career record of 453–334.[7] Winter was hired by Pete Newell as head coach of the Houston Rockets for two seasons, 1971–1973, posting a 51–78 (.395) record. In 1985, Winter started another chapter of his life after contemplating retirement, serving as an assistant coach with the Chicago Bulls, and teaching the triangle offense to Michael Jordan. He was hired to the position by General Manager Jerry Krause, an old friend he had met while at Kansas State. As an assistant to Phil Jackson, who took over as the Bulls' head coach in 1989, Winter and his ball-movement offense were an integral part of the Bulls' NBA championships in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, and 1998.[7] Winter followed Jackson to the Los Angeles Lakers. Led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the Lakers won three championships using the triangle system in 2000, 2001, and 2002.[7] Winter was also a consultant for the NBA champion 2008–09 Los Angeles Lakers team.[8] On April 25, 2009, Winter suffered a stroke in Manhattan, Kansas, while attending a Kansas State basketball reunion.[9] He lived near Kansas State in Manhattan, Kansas with his Alzheimer's-stricken wife[10] and son Brian. He suffered from the after-effects of his 2009 stroke, counting an uncooperative right side and nerve pain in his neck and shoulder.[11] He has two other sons, Russ and Chris. Winter died on October 10, 2018 at the age of 96.[12] Winter is a member of several halls of fame, including the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, and he was awarded the John Bunn Award for lifetime achievement from the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.[13] In June 2010, he was given the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award by the NBA Coaches Association.[14] On his eighth time on the final ballot for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, it was announced on April 2, 2011, that Winter had been elected. He was formally inducted on August 12, with his Boston-based physicist son Chris giving a speech in his behalf.[15] On May 26, 2012, Winter was inducted into the Compton Community College Athletics Hall of Fame, under the category of Basketball.",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/326.png

He made the NBA All-Rookie Team with the Lakers, and was then traded to the Milwaukee Bucks as part of the trade that brought Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the Lakers. He had a productive nine-year career that included two appearances in the NBA All-Star Game and playing on six playoffs teams. Winters averaged 16.2 points and 4.1 assists over his career, with his best years coming from 1975 to 1979 when he averaged over 19 points and slightly less than 5 assists per game.

Wittman starred for Indianapolis Ben Davis High School from 1975–1978. He averaged more than 23 points a game for Ben Davis, which remains the second highest average at the school, and became one of the nation's top recruits.[1] The 6'6"" Wittman played college basketball from 1979–1983 for Bob Knight and the Indiana University Hoosiers. The 1979–80 Hoosiers, led by Isiah Thomas, won the Big Ten championship and advanced to the 1980 Sweet Sixteen. The following season, in 1980–81, the Hoosiers once again won a conference title and advanced to the NCAA Championship, beating the North Carolina Tar Heels. The Hoosiers trailed the entire first half of the game until Wittman scored at the halftime buzzer with a deep corner shot.[2] The Hoosiers went on to win the game by a 63-50 tally, making the 1981 NCAA tournament the school's fourth national title. In 1982–1983, with the leadership of Wittman, the No. 1 ranked Hoosiers were favorites to win another national championship. However, with an injury to star player Ted Kitchel mid-season, the Hoosiers' prospects were grim. Knight asked for fan support to rally around the team and, despite long odds, the team ultimately won the Big Ten title. Nevertheless, in the tournament Kitchel's absence was felt and the team lost to Kentucky in the 1983 Sweet Sixteen. Wittman was named the Big Ten Player of the Year and a consensus second team All-American in 1983. He became a member of Indiana's Hall of Fame and was named to Indiana's Silver Anniversary Basketball Team, in March 1996. Wittman was selected by the Washington Bullets with the 22nd pick of the 1983 NBA draft. However, he never played for the Bullets with his rights being traded to the Atlanta Hawks. Wittman spent the early portion of his career with the Hawks, sharing backcourt with Glenn ""Doc"" Rivers and Anthony ""Spud"" Webb, and starting most of the games from 1985–88 (while averaging 12 points and 3.5 assists in those years combined). After a small spell with the Sacramento Kings, he became a fringe player with the Indiana Pacers, retiring in 1991–92 after three unassuming years. For his career, Wittman averaged 7.4 points, 1.1 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game, shooting just over 50% from the field. In 1992, Wittman began his NBA coaching career as an assistant coach, first with the Pacers. He spent one season in Indianapolis and another with the Dallas Mavericks (and later with the Orlando Magic). Subsequently, Wittman spent from 1994–99 with the Minnesota Timberwolves, in the same capacity. During that period, he helped in the development of Wolves' star forward Kevin Garnett. Wittman then served as head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers for two seasons, (1999–2001), compiling a record of 62-102. On January 23, 2007, Wittman became the head coach of the Timberwolves, succeeding Dwane Casey; he had already started the season as assistant to the former. On December 8, 2008, club owner Glen Taylor fired Wittman after a 4-19 start, asking Kevin McHale to step in, in a complete change of the organization's structure, as the former Boston Celtics great had been Minnesota's vice-president of basketball operations since 1995. Wittman became acting head coach of the Washington Wizards, accepting the position after Flip Saunders was fired in January 2012 for a 2-15 start. On June 4, 2012, the Wizards announced that Wittman would be retained as the official head coach of the team for the 2012–2013 season.[3] The Wizards improved from 29-53 to 44-38 during the 2013–14 season, which included advancing to the second round of the playoffs for just the third time since 1979 before losing to the Indiana Pacers in six games. The Wizards had a 5-1 record in away games during both series, but were unable to win a home game in the second round. Wittman was praised for his strategy and leadership throughout the playoffs by both players and management alike. Wittman signed an extension to remain head coach of the Wizards on June 3, 2014.[4] The Wizards fired Wittman on April 13, 2016 after the team missed the playoffs.[5][6] His son Ryan Wittman starred for the Cornell Big Red basketball team; he helped lead the Big Red to their first NCAA Tournament appearance in 20 years during the 2007–08 season, again in 2009,[7] and to Cornell's first-ever NCAA basketball tournament victories in 2010 over the Temple Owls and Wisconsin Badgers as the Big Red made its first-ever trip to the NCAA Men's Sweet 16.[8]",https://res.cloudinary.com/halcika/image/upload/v1582881622/coaches/328.png

He was previously best known as a head coach for the Atlanta Hawks and New York Knicks. Growing up in Indiana, Woodson felt the Hoosier Hysteria that permeated the state helped prepare him for a career in basketball. He said, ""Every yard had courts, little basketball hoops in the yard. If you didn't have it, you had neighbors two doors down that had it. You had parks in every area of town where you could go get a pickup game. Had rec centers where you could go play. It was a place to go learn your craft.""[1] He was also able to practice with a large number of talented basketball players in the Indianapolis area, including professionals such as George McGinnis, Roger Brown, and Rick Mount. According to Woodson, playing in Indiana meant ""you had to be able to pass, and shoot, and dribble, and play without the basketball, you know, the motion offense. That was Indiana basketball. And Bob Knight is the one who really instilled a lot of the fundamentals and how high school coaches taught their teams.""[1] Woodson elected to play college basketball for Bob Knight and the Indiana University Hoosiers. During one recruiting visit by Knight where Woodson's high school coach, his mother, and his pastor were all present, Knight got into a heated exchange because Woodson's high school coach was not convinced Woodson would fit into Indiana's system.[1] However, according to Woodson, ""I wanted to go somewhere where I could play, and where I knew I could get a great education, and my family didn't have to travel far to see me. So it was perfect. And I thought I was playing for the best coach in the country at that time.""[1] In Woodson's junior year, the 1978–79 season, he was the leading scorer on the Hoosier team that won the 1979 NIT Tournament. The 1979–80 Hoosiers, led by Woodson and Isiah Thomas, won the Big Ten championship and advanced to the 1980 Sweet Sixteen. Woodson finished his career at Indiana with 2,062 points. Woodson was selected 12th overall by the New York Knicks in the 1980 NBA draft and played in the league from 1980 until 1991. He spent two years in New York, before being traded to the New Jersey Nets. After playing seven games with the Nets, he was again traded to the Kansas City Kings. He enjoyed great success with the Kings, leading the team with 18.2 points per contest during a 1983 playoff run. He averaged 12.2 points over his career with the Kings (moving with the team to Sacramento). After success with that franchise, he finished his career by moving between several teams, making contributions in New Jersey, Los Angeles (with the Clippers), Houston, and Cleveland. Woodson served three seasons as an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks (1996–97 through 1998–99), Cleveland Cavaliers (1999–2000 through 2000–01), Philadelphia 76ers (2001–02 through 2002–03) and Detroit Pistons (2003–04). With the Pistons during the 2003–04 season he helped win an NBA Championship under head coach Larry Brown. Woodson was known for getting the most of defensive players, allowing teams coached by him and Brown to limit opponents to just under 42% shooting. For the 2004–05 season, Woodson took over as a head coach of the Atlanta Hawks, a position previously held by Terry Stotts. During his tenure with the Hawks from 2004–05 through 2009–10 he compiled a 206-286 (.419) record. In 2007–08, he led the Hawks to the playoffs for the first time in eight years. This would be the first of three consecutive playoff appearances. He led the Hawks into the Eastern Conference Semifinals in his last two seasons, compiling an overall Playoff mark of 11–18 (.379). The Hawks increased their win total in each of Woodson's six seasons in Atlanta, going from 13–69 in 2004–05 to 53–29 in 2009–10. Woodson's 206 career wins are fourth-best in Hawks franchise history, trailing only Richie Guerin (327), Mike Fratello (324) and Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens (310). However, after the Hawks lost their second round playoff series with the Orlando Magic 0-4 in 2010, general manager Rick Sund announced that the team would not attempt to re-sign Woodson, whose contract expired on May 17, 2010.[2] On August 29, 2011, the New York Knicks announced that Mike Woodson was hired as an assistant coach under head coach Mike D'Antoni. On March 14, 2012, Woodson was named interim head coach after D'Antoni's resignation.[3] In his debut as interim head coach that night, the Knicks crushed the Portland Trailblazers by a score of 121 to 79. Woodson was named the full-time head coach of the Knicks on May 25, 2012.[4] The Knicks ended the season strong under Mike Woodson, going 18–6 for an overall season record of 36–30, though they would lose 4–1 against the Miami Heat. In the 2012–13 season the Knicks under Woodson compiled a record of 54–28 and secured the second seed in the Eastern Conference. They reached the Eastern Conference Semifinals, where they lost to the Indiana Pacers in six games. The Knicks struggled to a 3–13 start in the 2013–2014 season and the team never fully recovered, finishing with a record of 37–45, and missing the playoffs for the first time in four seasons. On April 21, 2014, Woodson was fired from the New York Knicks head coaching position along with his entire coaching staff after two and a half seasons.[5] On September 29, 2014, the Los Angeles Clippers officially announced that Woodson had been hired as an assistant coach.[6] He would hold that position with the Clippers throughout the next four years, missing out on the playoffs in only his last season there. Woodson would later announce his resignation from his position with the Clippers on May 15, 2018.[7][8] On May 22, 2018, a week after his removal from the Clippers, it was rumored that the Phoenix Suns were planning to hire Woodson as an assistant coach under new head coach Igor Kokoškov.[9] However, no announcement by the Suns was made.
